              Our goal is to build world-class products. Contributing in the open source community, we try to flush the cloud-native wave moving on everyday.
              DCE 5.0 took two years from research, development, and test, to official release. Hundreds of elites from various industries gathered together.
              The newly launched DaoCloud Enterprise 5.0 can be used and built on demand just like Lego blocks.

              I'm actually a pure developer, and I may feel uncomfortable without coding for a day. From a coding point of view,
              the newly launched DaoCloud Enterprise has considerable advantages in terms of the community.
              DaoCloud has launched nearly 10 open source projects in GitHub.
              For example, KLTS is a cloud-native kernel specially maintained for DCE.
              As a tool for multi-cluster retrieval, Clusterpedia was successfully selected into the CNCF landscape within a few months of the project,
              which fully proves our influence in the open source community.
              In recent years, the company's open source technology has also been often mentioned by IDC and other survey agencies.
              The "English First" principle was set at the beginning of the development of DCE 5.0 UI, and its vision was set on the global market.

              The project management of R&D is more like Prometheus, and monitoring + correction is my main daily work.
              We have more than 10 Scrum teams in the development of DCE. As a R&D director that looks not very strong,
              I need to focus on the R&D progress, human resource load, product risk assessment, and OKR and process implementation for each Scrum team.
              Every night, I have to inspect on the development progress of the day, whether it can be further improved.
              The implementation of each feature is like taking care of my own children growing up.
