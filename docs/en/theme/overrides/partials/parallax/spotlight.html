              With one-click, create and join container clusters to achieve unified management of large-scale clusters across clouds/clusters.
              Graphically create pipelines to meet the needs of multiple scenarios.
              Distribute applications with one-stop, compatible with multi-modal applications. Comprehensively build a comprehensive production-ready cloud native management platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              You do not need to perceive the differences of the underlying Kubernetes platform by using the simplified deployment process.
              DCE 5.0 reduces the difficulty of cloud application, and allows users to focus on application development without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
              Meanwhile, it lays the foundation for allowing you to use multiple clusters as if you were using a single cluster.

              DCE 5.0 can guarantee high availability of applications, supports for distributed deployment of applications,
              and supports for automatic switching of traffic at a single point of failure. 
            <p>
              Compatible with traditional micro-service frameworks and cloud-native frameworks,
              DCE 5.0 can seamlessly use the traditional micro-service frameworks, highly compatible with traditional registries such as Zookeeper,
              as well as cloud-native Kubernetes and Mesh registries.
