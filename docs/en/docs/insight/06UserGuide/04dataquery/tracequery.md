# Trace query

Through link query, you can view detailed service request links to help you quickly locate faults.

1. In the left navigation, select `Data Query` -> `Trace Query`.

2. After configuring clusters, namespaces, services, operations, and labels, click `Search` to conduct precise searches. The search results are displayed by displaying the number of rows, and you can view the data of the custom time dimension of the past hour or day.
