# Node monitoring

Through node monitoring, you can get an overview of the current health status of the nodes in the selected cluster and the number of abnormalities in the corresponding container group; on the current node details page, you can view the number of alarms and the trend graph of resource consumption such as CPU, memory, and disk.

## Prerequisites

- The cluster has [insight-agent installed](../../06UserGuide/01quickstart/installagent.md) and the application is in `running` state.

## View node details

1. In the left navigation bar, select `Node Monitoring`, and the nodes under the first cluster are displayed by default.
