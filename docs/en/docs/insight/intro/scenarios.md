# Use cases

## Unified Collection and Observation of Multicluster Data

**Pain points**

- On-cloud, off-cloud, and multicloud environment systems cannot be managed in a unified manner, 
  and faults must be checked one by one, resulting in operation and maintenance inefficiency and high costs.
- Different data are collected separately, which leads to the inability to correlate and analyze the data, 
  and it is difficult to troubleshoot.

**Solution** 

- Insight supports one-click installation of Helm and graphical configuration management. It does not limit 
  the release version of Kubernetes, realizing the vision of "Insight on Any Kubernetes".
- Insight has one-stop collection and storage of logs, metrics, distributed traces, and event logs. 
  Full-stack data observation realizes the integration of data collection, storage, analysis, visualization and alert.
- Insight monitors real-time resources in various dimensions, including cluster monitoring, node monitoring, 
  workload monitoring, and service monitoring.

## Quick fault location and troubleshooting

**Pain points**

- In a complex microservice architecture, the maintenance cost of monitoring configuration increases, 
  so does the cost of locating service failures. The effective speed of monitoring faces huge challenges.
- The superposition of microservice architecture in the container environment makes troubleshooting complicated, 
  and it is necessary to avoid judging the root cause based on a single exception for troubleshooting.

**Solution**

- Draw a service map based on trace data to quickly locate abnormal services.
- After an abnormal application is found in the service map, the root cause of the fault can be clearly seen through one-click drill-down through the call chain.
- Query error logs by associating workloads to quickly resolve faults.
