# index capture method

Prometheus mainly captures the monitoring interface exposed by the target service through Pull, so it is necessary to configure the corresponding capture task to request monitoring data and write it into the storage provided by Prometheus. Currently, the Prometheus service provides the configuration of the following tasks :

- Native Job configuration: Provides the configuration of Prometheus's native grab job.
- Pod Monitor: In the K8S ecosystem, capture the corresponding monitoring data on the Pod based on the Prometheus Operator.
- Service Monitor: In the K8S ecosystem, based on the Prometheus Operator, the monitoring data on the corresponding Endpoints of the Service is captured.

!!! note

     ConfigMaps in [] are optional.

## Native Job configuration

The corresponding ConfigMaps are described as follows:

```yaml
# Grab the task name, and add a label(job=job_name) to the index corresponding to the grab
job_name: <job_name>

# Fetching task time interval
[ scrape_interval: <duration> | default = <global_config. scrape_interval> ]

# Fetch request timeout
[ scrape_timeout: <duration> | default = <global_config. scrape_timeout> ]

# fetch task request URI path
[ metrics_path: <path> | default = /metrics ]

# Solve the processing when the captured label conflicts with the label added by the backend Prometheus.
# true: Keep the captured label, ignore the label that conflicts with the backend Prometheus;
# false: For conflicting labels, add exported_<original-label> before the captured label, and add the label added by the backend Prometheus;
[ honor_labels: <boolean> | default = false ]

# Whether to use the time generated on the target.
# true: If there is a time in the target, use the time on the target;
# false: directly ignore the time on the target;
[ honor_timestamps: <boolean> | default = true ]

# Capture protocol: http or https
[ scheme: <scheme> | default = http ]

# Crawl request corresponding URL parameters
params:
   [ <string>: [<string>, ...] ]

# Set the value of `Authorization` in the crawl request header through basic auth, password/password_file are mutually exclusive, and the value in password_file is preferred.
basic_auth:
   [ username: <string> ]
   [ password: <secret> ]
   [ password_file: <string> ]

# Set the `Authorization` bearer_token/bearer_token_file mutual exclusion in the crawl request header through the bearer token, and the value in the bearer_token is preferred.
[ bearer_token: <secret> ]

# Set the `Authorization` bearer_token/bearer_token_file mutual exclusion in the crawl request header through the bearer token, and the value in the bearer_token is preferred.
[ bearer_token_file: <filename> ]

# Grab whether the connection passes through the TLS secure channel, and configure the corresponding TLS parameters
tls_config:
   [<tls_config>]

# Use the proxy service to capture the indicators on the target, and fill in the corresponding proxy service address.
[ proxy_url: <string> ]

# Specify the target through static configuration, see the description below for details.
static_configs:
   [ - <static_config> ... ]

# CVM service discovery configuration, see the description below for details.

   [ - <cvm_sd_config> ... ]

# After capturing the data, rewrite the corresponding label on the target through the relabel mechanism, and execute multiple relabel rules in sequence.
# relabel_config See below for details.
relabel_configs:
   [ - <relabel_config> ... ]

# Before the data is captured and written, rewrite the value corresponding to the label through the relabel mechanism, and execute multiple relabel rules in sequence.
# relabel_config See below for details.
metric_relabel_configs:
   [ - <relabel_config> ... ]

# One-time capture data point limit, 0: no limit, the default is 0

```yaml
# Corresponding to the name of the port, here you need to pay attention that it is not the corresponding port, default: 80, the corresponding value is as follows:
# ServiceMonitor: corresponding to Service>spec/ports/name;
# PodMonitor: The description is as follows:
# If viewing Pod Yaml, take the value in pod.spec.containers.ports.name.
# If you are looking at Deployment/Daemonset/Statefulset, take the value spec.template.spec.containers.ports.name
[port: string | default = 80]

```

### relabel_config

The corresponding ConfigMaps are described as follows:

```yaml
# Which label values are taken from the original labels for relabeling, and the extracted values are concatenated according to the definition in the separator.
# If it is PodMonitor/ServiceMonitor, the corresponding ConfigMap is sourceLabels
[ source_labels: '[' <labelname> [, ...] ']' ]
# Define the character that needs to be concatenated in the label value of relabel, the default is ';'.
[ separator: <string> | default = ; ]

# When the action is replace/hashmod, use target_label to specify the corresponding label name.
# If it is PodMonitor/ServiceMonitor, the corresponding ConfigMap is targetLabel
[ target_label: <labelname> ]

# An expression that needs to perform regular matching on the corresponding value of source labels
[ regex: <regex> | default = (.*) ]

# Action is used when hashmod is used, and the modulus value is taken according to the corresponding value md5 of the source label
[ modulus: <int> ]

# When the action is replace, use replacement to define the expression that needs to be replaced after the regex matches, which can be replaced with regex regular expressions
[ replacement: <string> | default = $1 ]

# Perform related operations based on the value matched by regex, the corresponding action is as follows, the default is replace:
# replace: If the regex matches, replace the corresponding value with the value defined in replacement, set the value through target_label and add the corresponding label
# keep: If the regex does not match, discard
# drop: if the regex matches, drop it
# hashmod: Take the modulus of the md5 value corresponding to the source label through the value specified by moduels
# And add a new label, the label name is specified by target_label
# labelmap: If the regex matches, use replacement to replace the corresponding label name
# labeldrop: If the regex matches, delete the corresponding label
# labelkeep: If the regex does not match, delete the corresponding label
[ action: <relabel_action> | default = replace ]
```
