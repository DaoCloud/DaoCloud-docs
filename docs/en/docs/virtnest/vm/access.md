# Connect to Virtual Machines

This article will introduce two methods for connecting to virtual machines: Console Access (VNC) and Terminal Access.

## Terminal Access

Accessing virtual machines through the terminal provides more flexibility and lightweight access. However, it does not directly display the graphical interface, has limited interactivity, and does not support multiple concurrent terminal sessions.

Click "Container Management" in the left navigation panel, then click "Virtual Machines" to access the list page. Click the __︙__ button on the right side of the list to access the virtual machine via the terminal.

## Console Access (VNC)

Accessing virtual machines through VNC allows you to access and control the full graphical interface of the remote computer. It provides a more interactive experience and allows intuitive operation of the remote device. However, it may have some performance impact, and it does not support multiple concurrent terminal sessions.

> Choose VNC for Windows systems.

Click "Container Management" in the left navigation panel, then click "Virtual Machines" to access the list page. Click the __︙__ button on the right side of the list to access the virtual machine via Console Access (VNC).
