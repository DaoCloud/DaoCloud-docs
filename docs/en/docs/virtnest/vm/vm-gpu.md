# Virtual Machine Configuration GPU (Nvidia)

This article will introduce the prerequisites for configuring GPU when creating a virtual machine.

The key point of configuring GPU for virtual machines is to configure the GPU Operator so that different software components can be deployed on working nodes depending on the GPU workloads configured on these nodes. Taking the following three nodes as examples:

- The controller-node-1 node is configured to run containers.
- The work-node-1 node is configured to run virtual machines with direct GPUs.
- The work-node-2 node is configured to run virtual machines with virtual vGPUs.

## Assumptions, Limitations, and Dependencies

Working nodes can run GPU-accelerated containers, virtual machines with direct GPUs, or virtual machines with vGPUs, but not a combination of any.

1. Working nodes can run GPU-accelerated containers, virtual machines with direct GPUs, or virtual machines with vGPUs separately, without supporting any combination forms.
2. Cluster administrators or developers need to understand the cluster situation in advance and correctly label the nodes to indicate the type of GPU workload they will run.
3. The working nodes running virtual machines with direct GPUs or vGPUs are assumed to be bare metal. If the working nodes are virtual machines, the GPU direct pass-through feature needs to be enabled on the virtual machine platform. Please consult the virtual machine platform provider.
4. Nvidia MIG vGPU is not supported.
5. The GPU Operator will not automatically install GPU drivers in virtual machines.

## Enable IOMMU

To enable the GPU direct pass-through feature, the cluster nodes need to enable IOMMU. Please refer to [How to Enable IOMMU](https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_7&p=kvm&f=10).
If your cluster is running on a virtual machine, consult your virtual machine platform provider.

## Build vGPU Manager Image

Note: Building a vGPU Manager image is only required when using NVIDIA vGPUs. If you plan to use only GPU direct pass-through, skip this section.

The following are the steps to build the vGPU Manager image and push it to the container registry:

1. Download the vGPU software from the NVIDIA Licensing Portal.

    - Log in to the NVIDIA Licensing Portal and go to the **Software Downloads** page.
    - The NVIDIA vGPU software is located in the **Driver downloads** tab on the **Software Downloads** page.
    - Select **VGPU + Linux** in the filter criteria and click **Download** to get the software package for Linux KVM.
      Unzip the downloaded file (`NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-<version>-vgpu-kvm.run`).

2. Clone the container-images/driver repository in the terminal

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/driver cd driver
    ```

3. Switch to the vgpu-manager directory for your operating system

    ```bash
    cd vgpu-manager/<your-os>
    ```

4. Copy the .run file extracted in step 1 to the current directory

    ```bash
    cp <local-driver-download-directory>/*-vgpu-kvm.run ./
    ```

5. Set environment variables

    - PRIVATE_REGISTRY: Name of the private registry to store the driver image.
    - VERSION: Version of NVIDIA vGPU Manager, downloaded from the NVIDIA Software Portal.
    - OS_TAG: Must match the operating system version of the cluster node.
    - CUDA_VERSION: CUDA base image version used to build the driver image.

    ```bash
    export PRIVATE_REGISTRY=my/private/registry VERSION=510.73.06 OS_TAG=ubuntu22.04 CUDA_VERSION=12.2.0
    ```

6. Build the NVIDIA vGPU Manager Image

    ```bash
    docker build \
      --build-arg DRIVER_VERSION=${VERSION} \
      --build-arg CUDA_VERSION=${CUDA_VERSION} \
      -t ${PRIVATE_REGISTRY}/vgpu-manager:${VERSION}-${OS_TAG} .
    ```

7. Push the NVIDIA vGPU Manager image to your container registry

    ```bash
    docker push ${PRIVATE_REGISTRY}/vgpu-manager:${VERSION}-${OS_TAG}
    ```

## Label Cluster Nodes

Go to **Container Management** , select your worker cluster and click **Nodes**. On the right of the list, click __â”‡__ and select **Edit Labels** to add labels to the nodes. Each node can only have one label.

You can assign the following values to the labels: container, vm-passthrough, and vm-vgpu.

## Install Nvidia Operator

1. Go to **Container Management** , select your worker cluster, click **Helm Apps** -> **Helm Charts** ,
   choose and install gpu-operator. You need to modify some fields in the yaml.

    ```yaml
    gpu-operator.sandboxWorkloads.enabled=true
    gpu-operator.vgpuManager.enabled=true
    gpu-operator.vgpuManager.repository=<your-register-url>      # (1)!
    gpu-operator.vgpuManager.image=vgpu-manager
    gpu-operator.vgpuManager.version=<your-vgpu-manager-version> # (2)!
    gpu-operator.vgpuDeviceManager.enabled=true
    ```

    1. Fill in the container registry address refered in the step "Build vGPU Manager Image".
    2. Fill in the VERSION refered in the step "Build vGPU Manager Image".

2. Wait for the installation to be successful, as shown in the image below:

    ![Installation Successful](../images/gpu-03.png)

## Install virtnest-agent and Configure CR

1. Install virtnest-agent, refer to [Install virtnest-agent](../install/virtnest-agent.md).

2. Add vGPU and GPU direct pass-through to the Virtnest Kubevirt CR.
   The following example shows the key yaml after adding vGPU and GPU direct pass-through:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      configuration:
        developerConfiguration:
          featureGates:
          - GPU
          - DisableMDEVConfiguration
        # Fill in the information below
        permittedHostDevices:
          mediatedDevices:            # vGPU
          - mdevNameSelector: GRID P4-1Q
            resourceName: nvidia.com /GRID_P4-1Q
        pciHostDevices:             # GPU direct pass-through
        - externalResourceProvider:  true
          pciVendorSelector: 10DE:1BB3
          resourceName: nvidia.com /GP104GL_TESLA_P4
    ```

3. In the kubevirt CR yaml, `permittedHostDevices` is used to import VM devices,
   and vGPU should be added in `mediatedDevices` with the following structure:

    ```yaml
    mediatedDevices:          
    - mdevNameSelector: GRID P4-1Q          # Device Name
      resourceName: nvidia.com/GRID_P4-1Q   # vGPU information registered by GPU Operator to the node
    ```

4. GPU direct pass-through should be added in `pciHostDevices` under `permittedHostDevices` with the following structure:

    ```yaml
    pciHostDevices:           
    - externalResourceProvider: true           # Do not change by default
      pciVendorSelector: 10DE:1BB3              # Vendor id of the current pci device
      resourceName: nvidia.com/GP104GL_TESLA_P4 # GPU information registered by GPU Operator to the node
    ```

5. Example of obtaining vGPU information (only applicable to vGPU): View node information on a node marked as `nvidia.com/gpu.workload.config=vm-vgpu` (e.g., work-node-2), and the `nvidia.com/GRID_P4-1Q: 8` in Capacity indicates available vGPUs:

    ```bash
    # kubectl describe node work-node-2
    Capacity:
      cpu:                                 64
      devices.kubevirt.io/kvm:             1k
      devices.kubevirt.io/tun:             1k
      devices.kubevirt.io/vhost-net:       1k
      ephemeral-storage:                   102626232Ki
      hugepages-1Gi:                       0
      hugepages-2Mi:                       0
      memory:                              264010840Ki
      nvidia.com/GRID_P4-1Q :              8
      pods:                                110
    Allocatable:
      cpu:                               	64
      devices.kubevirt.io/kvm:           	1k
      devices.kubevirt.io/tun:           	1k
      devices.kubevirt.io/vhost-net:     	1k
      ephemeral-storage:                 	94580335255
      hugepages-1Gi:                     	0
      hugepages-2Mi:                     	0
      memory:                            	263908440Ki
      nvidia.com/GRID_P4-1Q:             	8
      pods:                              	110
    ```

    So the `mdevNameSelector` should be "GRID P4-1Q" and the `resourceName` should be "GRID_P4-1Q".

6. Obtain GPU direct pass-through information: On a node marked as `nvidia.com/gpu.workload.config=vm-passthrough` (e.g., work-node-1), view the node information, and `nvidia.com/GP104GL_TESLA_P4: 2` in Capacity indicates available vGPUs:

    ```bash
    # kubectl describe node work-node-1
    Capacity:
      cpu:                            64
      devices.kubevirt.io/kvm:        1k
      devices.kubevirt.io/tun:        1k
      devices.kubevirt.io/vhost-net:  1k
      ephemeral-storage:              102626232Ki
      hugepages-1Gi:                  0
      hugepages-2Mi:                  0
      memory:                         264010840Ki
      nvidia.com/GP104GL_TESLA_P4:    2
      pods:                           110
    Allocatable:
      cpu:                            64
      devices.kubevirt.io/kvm:        1k
      devices.kubevirt.io/tun:        1k
      devices.kubevirt.io/vhost-net:  1k
      ephemeral-storage:              94580335255
      hugepages-1Gi:                  0
      hugepages-2Mi:                  0
      memory:                         263908440Ki
      nvidia.com/GP104GL_TESLA_P4:    2
      pods:                           110
    ```

    So the `resourceName` should be "GRID_P4-1Q". How to obtain the `pciVendorSelector`? SSH into the target node work-node-1 and use the command "lspci -nnk -d 10de:" to get the Nvidia GPU PCI information, as shown in the image above.

7. Editing kubevirt CR note: If there are multiple GPUs of the same model, only one needs to be written in the CR, listing each GPU is not necessary.

    ```bash
    # kubectl -n virtnest-system edit kubevirt kubevirt
    spec:
      configuration:
        developerConfiguration:
          featureGates:
          - GPU
          - DisableMDEVConfiguration
        # Fill in the information below
        permittedHostDevices:
          mediatedDevices:                    # vGPU
          - mdevNameSelector: GRID P4-1Q
            resourceName: nvidia.com/GRID_P4-1Q
        pciHostDevices:                       # GPU direct pass-through, in the above example, TEESLA P4 has two GPUs, only register one here
          - externalResourceProvider: true
            pciVendorSelector: 10DE:1BB3
            resourceName: nvidia.com/GP104GL_TESLA_P4 
    ```

## Create VM YAML and Use GPU Acceleration

The only difference from a regular virtual machine is adding GPU-related information in the devices section.
