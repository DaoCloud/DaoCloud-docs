# Pushing an Image to the Container Registry

After creating managed Harbor and registry space, you can follow the instructions below to log in and push the image to 
the container registry or log in to native Harbor to view the guidance provided by native Harbor under each registry space (project).

## Push method 1

**Prerequisites:** Managed Harbor and registry space have been created.

You can build a new container image locally or grab a public image from DockerHub for testing. This page takes 
the latest official Nginx image of DockerHub as an example. Run the following commands in sequence in the 
command line tool to push the image. Please replace "library" and "nginx" with the name of the registry space 
and container registry you actually created.

1. Log in to the container registry using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker login --username=<container registry login name> <container registry address>
    ```

    Example：

    ```bash
    docker login --username=admin http://test.lrf02.kangaroo.com
    ```

    Enter the container registry password in the returned result (the password set when creating managed Harbor).

2. Tag the image using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker tag <container registry name>:<artifact version> <container registry address>/<registry space name>/<container registry name>:<artifact version>
    ```

    Example：

    ```bash
    docker tag nginx:latest test.lrf02.kangaroo.com/library/nginx:latest
    ```

3. Push the image to the registry space library using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker push <container registry address>/<registry space name>/<container registry name>:<artifact version>
    ```

    Example：

    ```bash
    docker push test.lrf02.kangaroo.com/library/nginx:latest
    ```

4. Pull the image using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker pull <container registry address>/<registry space name>/<container registry name>:<artifact version>
    ```

    Example：

    ```bash
    docker pull test.lrf02.kangaroo.com/library/nginx:latest
    ```

## Push method 2

**Prerequisites:** Managed Harbor and registry space have been created.

1. On the Managed Harbor list page, click __...__ on the right side of the target registry,
   then click __Native Harbor__ to enter the login page of the native Harbor.

    ![native harbor](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/kangaroo/images/push01.png)

2. Enter the username and password set when creating managed Harbor to enter native Harbor.

    ![login harbor](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/kangaroo/images/push02.png)

3. Click the name of the target registry space (project) to enter the registry space.

    ![registry space](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/kangaroo/images/push03.png)

4. Click the push command on the right to view the push commands provided by native Harbor.

    ![push command](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/kangaroo/images/push03.png)

!!! Tip

    Compared with [method 1](#push-method-1), the push command of the native Harbor automatically
    fills in the address of the container registry and the name of the registry space.
