# Create registry space

Harbor provides the image isolation function based on the image space (project). There are two types of registry spaces: public and private:

- Public container registry: all users can access, usually store public images, there is a library public registry space by default.
- Private container registry: Only authorized users can access it, usually storing the image of the registry space itself.

Prerequisite: An external Harbor repository has been created or integrated.

1. Log in to the web console as a user with the Admin role, and click `container registry` from the left navigation bar.

!!! info

    If the status of the image space is public, the images in the space can be pulled and used by all Kubernetes namespaces on the platform;
    If the status of the image space is private, the image space can only be pulled and used by the Kubernetes namespace under the workspace (tenant) after the administrator Admin binds the image space to one or more workspaces (tenants).
