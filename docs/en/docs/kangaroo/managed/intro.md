# Manage Harbor

Harbor is an open-source container registry service for safe hosting and efficient distribution of OCI-compliant Artifacts 
such as container images and Helm Charts.
It can help you manage Artifact consistently and securely across cloud native computing platforms 
such as Kubernetes and Docker.
DCE 5.0 provides a fast deployment capability based on Harbor, and through a series of convenient channels such as 
connecting with Workbench and container management module in the platform, and binding with the workspace,
It realizes a one-stop high-availability, high-performance, and high-efficiency deployment, management, 
and use of full-cycle container registry services.

## Product Features

- Support multi-copy deployment to achieve high availability
- Support importing platform users into native Harbor instances
- Provide a native Harbor instance entry, and the user's operations on the platform UI and operations in the native Harbor will take effect in real time
- Support using the platform to build a database or access an external database
- Support using the platform to build a Redis instance or access an external Redis instance
- Support specifying internal storage or using external S3 compatible object storage

## Functional advantages

- Provides numerous container registry instances to meet the needs of multiple container registries in various environments 
  such as development, testing, and production.
- Breaks the calling barriers between modules, and supports rapid image pull when deploying applications in Workbench 
  and container management module
- Provides a unified management control plane, allowing administrators to manage the full life cycle of multiple 
  Harbor instances on the same interface.
