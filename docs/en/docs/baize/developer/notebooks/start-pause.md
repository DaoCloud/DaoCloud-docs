# Start and Stop Notebook

After a Notebook is successfully created, it typically has several states:

- Pending
- Running
- Stopped

If a Notebook is in the **Stopped** state, click the **â”‡** on the right side in the list, then choose **Start** from the dropdown menu.

<!-- add image later -->

This Notebook will move into the running queue, and its status will change to **Pending**. If everything is normal, its status will change to **Running** after a moment.

If you have finished using the Notebook, you can choose **Stop** from the menu to change its status to **Stopped**.
