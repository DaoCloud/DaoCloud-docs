# Create Queue

In the Operator mode, queues can be used to schedule and optimize batch job workloads, effectively managing multiple tasks running on a cluster and optimizing resource utilization through a queue system.

1. Click **Queue Management** in the left navigation bar, then click the **Create** button on the right.
