# Delete Queue

In the Operator mode, if you find a queue to be redundant, expired, or no longer needed for any other reason, you can delete it from the queue list.

1. Click the **â”‡** on the right side of the queue in the queue list, then choose **Delete** from the dropdown menu.

    ![delete](../../images/q-delete01.png)

2. In the pop-up window, confirm the queue you want to delete, enter the queue name, and then click **Delete**.

    ![confirm](../../images/delete02.png)

3. A confirmation message will appear indicating successful deletion, and the queue will disappear from the list.

!!! caution

    Once a queue is deleted, it cannot be recovered, so please proceed with caution.
