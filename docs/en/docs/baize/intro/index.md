# What is AI Lab

AI Lab is a cloud native AI computing platform developed by DaoCloud that can running on any K8s-based system.
This innovative platform, known as Cloud Native AI Platform, offers a seamless integration of software
and hardware for a superior AI computing experience. AI Lab combines various computing powers,
optimizes GPU performance, streamlines the scheduling and management of computing resources,
and enhances computing efficiency. With its focus on reducing costs and simplifying AI development,
AI Lab provides optimized AI development frameworks that accelerate the implementation of AI applications
across different industries.

**Key Features**

- Fully Managed Computing Resources

    Powered by DCE (DaoCloud Enterprise), AI Lab offers robust infrastructure capabilities to support
    large-scale computing clusters, heterogeneous GPUs, and comprehensive hosting services.
    It also includes integrated acceleration solutions like vGPU.

- Dataset Management

    AI Lab supports efficient dataset management during model development, with features such as
    dataset organization, multi-data source access, and dataset preloading.
    The underlying container storage engine ensures smooth and effective data processing.

- Development Environment Management

    AI Lab caters to the requirements of MLOps and LLMOps engineers by providing a range of
    development environments, including JupyterLab and upcoming support for VSCode. It allows
    for custom development environments and easy access to GPU, dataset, and other resources.

- Job Management

    AI Lab offers comprehensive job lifecycle management, enabling quick creation of jobs and support
    for popular job frameworks like Pytorch, TensorFlow, and PaddlePaddle. It includes various
    job scheduling options, such as single-machine, distributed, multi-node, and multi-GPU setups.

- GPU Management

    Users can monitor GPU resources and usage through AI Lab, with features for tracking current
    and historical job activities on GPUs. This facilitates GPU stress assessment and optimization.

- Queue Management

    AI Lab allows for the creation of queues and their association with workspaces to ensure
    efficient coordination and resource isolation within different clusters.
