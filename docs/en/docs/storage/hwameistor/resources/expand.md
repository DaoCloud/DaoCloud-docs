# Volume Expansion

HwameiStor supports `CSI Volume Expansion`. This feature enables online expansion of volumes by
modifying the size of `PVC`. Currently, it supports both manual and automatic expansion methods.

## Manual Expansion

1. Access the proper cluster and navigate to **Container Storage** -> **HwameiStor**

2. Click **Local Volumes** . On the right side of the local volume list, click **â”‡** and select **Expand** .

3. In the **Expand** dialog box, enter the new size for expansion. In this example, expand from `1G` to `10G`, then click **OK** .

4. Refresh the current list and check that the capacity of the current local volume has changed from `1G` to `10G`.

## Automatic Expansion

The component hwameistor-pvc-autoresizer provides the capability for automatic PVC expansion.
The expansion behavior is controlled by the `ResizePolicy` CRD.

### ResizePolicy

Below is an example CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: hwameistor.io/v1alpha1
kind: ResizePolicy
metadata:
  name: resizepolicy1
spec:
  warningThreshold: 60
  resizeThreshold: 80
  nodePoolUsageLimit: 90
```

The three int-type fields `warningThreshold`, `resizeThreshold`, and `nodePoolUsageLimit` represent percentages.

- `warningThreshold` is currently not associated with any alert action. It serves as a target ratio, meaning that
  after expansion, the volume usage will be below this percentage.
- `resizeThreshold` indicates a usage ratio. When the volume usage reaches this percentage, the expansion action
  will be triggered.
- `nodePoolUsageLimit` represents the upper limit of node StorageClass usage. If the usage of a StorageClass reaches
  this percentage, the volumes in this StorageClass will not be automatically expanded.

### Matching Rules

This is an example CR with a label-selector.

```yaml
apiVersion: hwameistor.io/v1alpha1
kind: ResizePolicy
metadata:
  name: example-policy
spec:
  warningThreshold: 60
  resizeThreshold: 80
  nodePoolUsageLimit: 90
  storageClassSelector:
    matchLabels:
      pvc-resize: auto
  namespaceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      pvc-resize: auto
  pvcSelector:
    matchLabels:
      pvc-resize: auto
```

`ResizePolicy` has three label-selectors:

- `pvcSelector` indicates that the PVCs selected by this selector will be automatically expanded according to the policy.
- `namespaceSelector` indicates that the PVCs in the namespaces selected by this selector
  will be automatically expanded according to the policy.
- `storageClassSelector` indicates that the PVCs created from the StorageClass selected by
  this selector will be automatically expanded according to the policy.

These three selectors have an "AND" relationship. If you specify multiple selectors in a `ResizePolicy`, only
the PVCs that meet all the selectors will match the policy. If no selector is specified in the `ResizePolicy`,
it becomes a cluster-wide `ResizePolicy`, acting as the default policy for all PVCs in the cluster.

### How to Watch the Expansion Process

The more capacity added, the longer the expansion time required. You can watch the entire expansion process in the `PVC` event logs.

```shell
kubectl describe pvc data-sts-mysql-local-0
```

```none
