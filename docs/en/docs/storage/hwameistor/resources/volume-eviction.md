# Volume Eviction

Volume eviction is an important feature of the HwameiStor system, ensuring the continuous and normal
operation of HwameiStor in production environments. When a Kubernetes node or an application pod is
evicted for any reason, the system automatically discovers the HwameiStor volumes associated with the
node or the pod, and migrates them to other nodes, ensuring that the evicted pod can be scheduled to
other nodes and run normally. In addition, operators can manually migrate volumes to balance system
resources and ensure smooth operation of the system. Refer to [Volume Migration](./migrate.md).

## Evict a node

In a Kubernetes system, you can use the following command to evict a node, removing and migrating
the pods running on that node to other nodes. At the same time, The HwameiStor migrates the volume
used by the pod from the current node to other nodes, ensuring that the pod can run normally on the
other nodes.

```bash
kubectl drain k8s-node-1 --ignore-daemonsets=true
```

You can use the following command to check if the associated HwameiStor volumes have been successfully migrated.

```bash
kubectl get LocalStorageNode k8s-node-1 -o yaml
```

The output will be similar to:

```yaml

kind: LocalStorageNode

      usedVolumeCount: 1
      volumeCapacityBytesLimit: 17175674880
      volumes: # Ensure that the volumes field is empty
  state: Ready
```

You can also use the following command to check if there are any HwameiStor volumes on the evicted node.

```bash
kubectl get localvolumereplica
```

The output will be similar to:

```console

```

In some cases, when restarting a node, you may want to keep the volumes on that node. You can do this
by adding the following label to the node:

```bash
kubectl label node k8s-node-1 hwameistor.io/eviction=disable
```

## Evict a pod

When a Kubernetes node is under heavy load, the system selectively evicts some pods to free up system
resources and ensure the normal operation of other pods. If a pod that uses HwameiStor volumes is evicted,
the system automatically captures this evicted pod and migrates the associated HwameiStor volumes to other
nodes, ensuring that the Pod can be scheduled and run on other nodes.

## Migrate a pod

Operators can manually migrate application pods and the associated HwameiStor volumes to balance system
resources and ensure smooth operation of the system. There are two ways to perform manual migration:

- Method 1

  ```bash
  kubectl label pod mysql-pod hwameistor.io/eviction=start
  kubectl delete pod mysql-pod
  ```

- Method 2

  ```console
  $ cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
  apiVersion: hwameistor.io/v1alpha1
  kind: LocalVolumeMigrate
  metadata:
    name: migrate-pvc-6ca4c0d4-da10-4e2e-83b2-19cbf5c5e3e4
  spec:
    sourceNode: k8s-node-1
    targetNodesSuggested: 
    - k8s-node-2
    - k8s-node-3
    volumeName: pvc-6ca4c0d4-da10-4e2e-83b2-19cbf5c5e3e4
    migrateAllVols: true
  EOF

  $ kubectl delete pod mysql-pod
  ```
