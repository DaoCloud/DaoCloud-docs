# DRBD installer

DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) is composed of Linux kernel modules and related scripts to build high-availability clusters. It is achieved by image the entire device over the network, which can be thought of as a network RAID.

This installer can directly install DRBD into the container cluster, currently this module is only for testing purposes.
