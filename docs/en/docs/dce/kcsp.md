# K8s Certified Service Provider

The CNCF provides compliance certification for Kubernetes platform vendors around the world to validate product capabilities and delivery quality.

DaoCloud is a [CNCF-certified Kubernetes Certified Service Provider (KCSP)](https://landscape.cncf.io/?group=certified-partners-and-providers&item=platform--certified-kubernetes-distribution--daocloud-enterprise).
As early as 2017, DaoCloud passed the official certification, becoming one of the earliest CNCF-recognized Kubernetes service providers in China.  
We have remained deeply involved in the community for years — contributing code, docs and practices — and always stay aligned with the community’s upstream. With every new Kubernetes release, we are among the first to adapt and enhance new features, and deliver them into production environments.

## Kubernetes AI Conformance

To support the explosive growth of AI/ML workloads — and their needs for compute and hardware acceleration — CNCF launched the [Kubernetes AI Conformance](https://github.com/cncf/ai-conformance) standard.  
On top of the base [Kubernetes Conformance](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance) requirements, it defines AI-specific functions, APIs and configuration rules, establishing a unified baseline for **consistent portability** and **efficient scheduling** of AI workloads across environments.

Certified platforms are authorized by CNCF to use the “AI Conformance” badge — meaning the distribution is recognized as AI-friendly and ready for AI/ML production use.

As a leader in cloud-native open source in China, DaoCloud keeps pace with the community:  
after the AI Conformance standard was released, we were among the first to start AI Conformance testing for the mainstream Kubernetes v1.33 on our [DCE 5.0](https://docs.daocloud.io/) platform, and in October 2025 we [successfully passed the certification](https://github.com/cncf/ai-conformance/pull/13) —  
**becoming the first enterprise-grade AI/ML platform in China to achieve certification for this version.**
