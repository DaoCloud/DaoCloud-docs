# DaoCloud Enterprise 5.0

On the occasion of the golden Autumn of 2022, DaoCloud gladly launches the next-generation, cloud-native, containerized, comprehensive platform by fusing the most popular cloud-native technologies in the open source community. After two years of continuous development, testing, and verification by hundreds of diligent developers, the flower of idealism finally blooms in the land of romantic open-source community. The new platform leads the paces and waves of cloud-native development globally.

DaoCloud Enterprise 5.0 or DCE 5.0 for short, is a high-performance and scalable cloud-native operating system. It is developed with many independent modules. You can use each of them like LEGO bricks, with zero downtime while upgrading one of modules. DCE 5.0 is easy to integrate with hundreds of cloud-native plugins, so you can simply custom solutions for different scenarios. Things go better with such as modular construction.

DCE 5.0 has built a highly adaptable Container Management, which can uniformly manage almost all kinds of containerized clusters on the market, with the feature of Multicloud Management to use OpenShift, VMware, and public clouds at the same time. It can centrally control the apps from app stores and registry, natively integrates the CI/CD pipeline and application workbench, and endows the most cutting-edge service mesh and microservice technology. You can easily get insight from detailed and customized metrics of clusters, nodes, workloads, and services. With the support of various types of selected databases and middleware such as RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, MySQL, Redis, etc., you can easily learn the current service status in time from the dynamically updated dashboard and topology map, through which you can deep dive into your business data to help you make valuable decisions in advance to boost your business.

=== "Microservice Governance"

    **Applicable scenarios**

    An enterprise decides to adopt a microservice architecture or has already adopted microservices, hopes to obtain a full range of technical support and O&M capabilities such as a microservice framework, or hopes to use service mesh technologies, and tries to achieve smoothness in the process of digital transformation.

    - The enterprise doesn't want to change anything, but just wants to view various service states via a panoramic view, and hopes to easily troubleshoot faults with traces and logs.
    - The enterprise has the idea of tranforming from the traditional microservice framework to service mesh, but it is more conservative. It is hoped that there will be a transition period for the gradual transformation. At this time, it is more suitable to use a service mesh solution.
    - The enterprise hopes to directly tranform to service mesh. In this case, it is a good idea to remove Eureka-related components and directly use the microservice engine and service mesh.
    - The enterprise does not want to tranform from traditional microservices to mesh, but wants to do east-west traffic management.

    **Benefits**

    Seamless integrate with legacy and popular microservice technologies, such as the first-generation microservices represented by SpringCloud and Dubbo and the new generation of microservices represented by Istio service mesh, with the lifecycle management capabilities of development, deployment, joining, exposing to external, observation, and O&M. Seamlessly add the existing microservice system of the enterprise, provide the complete capabilities of managed microservice governance, and offer the high-performance cloud-native microservice gateway.

Just like Lego bricks, it combines dozens of the best open source technologies into a platform. After many dialectical selection, adaptation and running-in, coding debugging, and massive testing, a sword is sharpened in ten years. The new generation of containerized platforms can meet the needs of various scenarios for enterprises migrating to the cloud.
