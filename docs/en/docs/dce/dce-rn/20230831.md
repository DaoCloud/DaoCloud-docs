## Upgrade Considerations

- **Microservice Engine**: When upgrading Microservice Engine to a version greater than v0.24.2, there are
  incompatible updates for versions up to v0.24.2. Since the gateway involves changes in the URL of
  the open-source component repository, you need to manually delete the existing __gateway-api-admission-xxxxx__
  Job before performing the normal upgrade process.
- **Global Management**: When upgrading from v0.15.x (or lower) to v0.20.0 (or higher),
  the database connection Helm parameters format need to be modified. For more details, refer to
  [Offline Upgrade of Global Management](../../ghippo/install/offline-install.md).
