## Upgrade Considerations

- **Container Management**: When upgrading from v0.21.x to v0.22.0 or later, if the Global cluster is
  using Redis in sentinel mode, the __--set global.db.redis.url__ needs to be modified during the upgrade.
- **Global Management**: When upgrading from v0.15.x (or lower) to v0.21.0 (or later), the format of
  the database connection Helm parameter needs to be modified. Refer to the
  [offline upgrade for global management](../../ghippo/install/offline-install.md) for more details.
- **Insight**: For Insight Agent versions 0.20.0 and below, there is a known issue with collecting
  multiple JVM metric data using PodMonitor. Configuration changes are required. Refer to the
  [PodMonitor collects multiple JVM metric data](../../insight/quickstart/install/knownissues.md#podmonitor-jvm) for more information.
