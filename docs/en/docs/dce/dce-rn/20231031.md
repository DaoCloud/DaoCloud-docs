This page explains the latest features, optimizations, bug fixes, and more included in DCE 5.0 v0.12.0-20231031 Enterprise.
Each product module in DCE 5.0 is independently decoupled, and the versions included in this release are the ones that come with the DCE 5.0 installer by default.
If you need to independently upgrade or replace each module, please contact Daocloud's customer support personnel to download the proper version and perform the upgrade.
Also, refer to the [Enterprise Deployment Requirements](../../install/commercial/deploy-requirements.md).

## Upgrade Considerations

- **Container Management**: When upgrading from v0.21.x to v0.22.0 or later, if the Global cluster is
  using Redis in sentinel mode, the __--set global.db.redis.url__ needs to be modified during the upgrade.
- **Global Management**: When upgrading from v0.15.x (or lower) to v0.21.0 (or later), the format of
  the database connection Helm parameter needs to be modified. Refer to the
  [offline upgrade for global management](../../ghippo/install/offline-install.md) for more details.
- **Insight**: For Insight Agent versions 0.20.0 and below, there is a known issue with collecting
  multiple JVM metric data using PodMonitor. Configuration changes are required. Refer to the
  [PodMonitor collects multiple JVM metric data](../../insight/quickstart/install/knownissues.md#podmonitor-jvm) for more information.
