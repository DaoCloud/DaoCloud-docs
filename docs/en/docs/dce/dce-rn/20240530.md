## Upgrade Notes

- **Installer**: When upgrading DCE 5.0 product components from lower versions to v0.16.0, the upgrade will fail.
  It is recommended to upgrade to v0.16.1. If using v0.16.0, disable the Insight component in mainfest.yaml
  during the upgrade.
- **Container Management**: When upgrading from Kpanda v0.21.x to v0.22.0 and later versions,
  if the Global cluster uses Redis in sentinel mode, you need to change `--set global.db.redis.url` during the upgrade.
- **Global Management**: When upgrading from v0.15.x (or lower) to v0.27.0 (or higher), the database parameters
  to connect the Helm needs to be modified. Refer to
  [Offline Upgrade Global Management](https://docs.daocloud.io/ghippo/install/offline-install/) for details.
- **Workbench**:

    - Upgrading from versions before v0.21.0 to this version may cause GitOps applications to disappear. It is recommended not to upgrade to this version and directly upgrade to versions after v0.22.0.
    - In v0.27.0, native applications, helm applications, and OLM applications will report errors after clicking operations in the list under the all-namespace mode. A separate upgrade to v0.27.1 is required.
    
- **Insight**: Due to breaking changes in Insight v0.25.0, when upgrading Insight Server to v0.25.x, Insight Agent must also be upgraded to v0.25.x simultaneously.
- **Redis Cache Service**:

    - When upgrading from Redis v0.14.0 (or lower) to v0.16.0 and below, the iteration includes an upgrade of the Redis Operator, which will cause a restart of Redis standalone, master-slave, and sentinel instances during the upgrade.
    - When upgrading from Redis v0.15.0 (or lower) to v0.16.0 and below, the iteration includes an upgrade of the Redis Operator (redis-ha-operator), which will cause a restart of Redis sentinel instances during the upgrade.
