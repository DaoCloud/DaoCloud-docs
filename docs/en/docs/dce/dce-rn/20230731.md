## Upgrade Considerations

- **Microservice Engine**: When upgrading from a version greater than v0.24.2 of Microservice Engine, there is an incompatible update regarding the gateway due to changes in the open-source component repository. Therefore, before upgrading, manually delete the old `gateway-api-admission-xxxxx` Job and then proceed with the normal upgrade process.
- **Global Management**: When upgrading from v0.15.x (or lower) to v0.19.0 (or higher) of Global Management, the database connection Helm parameter format needs to be modified. For details, refer to [Offline Upgrade of Global Management](../../ghippo/install/offline-install.md).
