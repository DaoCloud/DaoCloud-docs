## Upgrade Considerations

- **Installer**: Upgrading DCE 5.0 product components from a lower version to v0.16.0 will fail, it is recommended to upgrade to v0.16.1. If using v0.16.0, when upgrading, disable the Insight component in the mainfest.yaml
- **Container Management**: When upgrading from Kpanda v0.21.x version to v0.22.0 and later versions, if the Global cluster uses Redis in sentinel mode, the upgrade requires changing `--set global.db.redis.url`
- **Global Management**: When upgrading from v0.15.x (or lower versions) to v0.25.0 (or higher versions), the database connection Helm parameter format needs to be modified, refer to [Offline Upgrade Global Management](https://docs.daocloud.io/ghippo/install/offline-install/)
- **Workbench**: When upgrading from versions before amamba v0.21.0 to this version, GitOps applications may disappear. It is recommended not to upgrade to this version directly, but upgrade directly to versions after v0.22.0
- **Insight**: Due to disruptive changes in Insight v0.25.0, when upgrading Insight Server to v0.25.x, the Insight Agent version also needs to be upgraded to v0.25.x
- **Redis Cache Service**:
    - When upgrading from Redis v0.14.0 (or lower versions) to v0.16.0 and below versions, the iteration includes upgrading Redis Operator, which will cause Redis standalone, master-slave, and sentinel instances to restart during the upgrade
    - When upgrading from Redis v0.15.0 (or lower versions) to v0.16.0 and below versions, it includes upgrading Redis Operator (redis-ha-operator), which will cause Redis sentinel instances to restart during the upgrade
