## Upgrade Notes

- Insight: When upgrading the **insight agent** from v0.16.x (or lower) to v0.17.x,
  since the kube-prometheus-stack chart version has been upgraded from 41.9.1 to 45.28.1,
  and some fields in the used CRD need to be upgraded manually,
  please refer to [Insight upgrade notes](../../insight/quickstart/install/upgrade-note.md) for details.

- Microservice Engine: The database initialization component sweet has been deprecated
  since v0.22.0 and will be completely removed in version 0.23.0 and later.
  Starting from v0.22.0, data tables will be automatically synchronized and updated without manual intervention.

- Global Management: When upgrading from v0.15.x (or lower) to v0.17.0 (or higher),
  the format of the database connection helm parameters needs to be modified.
  Please refer to [Offline upgrade global management](../../ghippo/install/offline-install.md) for details.

## Known Issues

- Container Registry: Expired login instructions will cause the service to become unavailable.
  Please extend the expiration time in a timely manner when using login instructions.
  This issue will be fixed in the hotfix version.

- Installer: In the offline scenario, when an external OS Repo repository is used, that is,
  `osRepos.type=external` is defined in `clusterConfig.yaml`, it is not possible to create a
  working cluster in container management after the successful deployment of DCE5.0.
  Please refer to the [documentation](../../install/release-notes.md#known-issues) for solutions.

## Compatibility

!!! note

    Global Management: Once global management is upgraded to v0.17.0 or v0.16.0 and above versions,
