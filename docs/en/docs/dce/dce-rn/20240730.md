## Upgrade Notes

- Container Storage: Since the HwameiStor component updated its default reclaim policy (ReclaimPolicy)
  from delete (Delete) to retain (Retain) after v0.14.8, this action is to make data safer and prevent
  data loss due to accidental deletion of pvc by users. Administrators can manually clear the associated
  storage data PersistentVolume volumes and LocalVolume volumes.
- Insight: When upgrading insight-agent to v0.29.x, since v0.29.0 upgraded the Opentelemetry community's
  operator chart version, the supported values of featureGates in values have changed. Therefore,
  before upgrading, you need to set the values of featureGates to empty. Refer to
  [Insight Upgrade Notes](../../insight/quickstart/install/upgrade-note.md).
