# Override Policies

The role of Override Policy is to define the configurations delivered to different clusters, which can be different. 
For example, the addresses of the mirror warehouses corresponding to different clusters are different, 
so they need to be set in different clusters. The mirroring addresses of the workloads in the server are different. 
For example, in different environments, different environment variables need to be set. The timing of Override Policy 
is after the Propagation Policy and before it is actually delivered to the cluster.

Multicloud Management supports Override Policy, supports viewing the list of override policies of the current instance
and its associated multicloud resources on the interface, and can create and update the information of override policies 
through forms and YAML. Override Policy is divided into Namespace Scope and Cluster Scope.

## Create from YAML

Follow the steps below to create an override policy using YAML.

1. After entering a multicloud instance, in the left navigation bar, click __Policy Management__ -> __Override Policies__ , and click the __Create from YAML__ button.

    ![Namespace Scope](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/kairship/images/op001.png)

2. On the __Create from YAML__ page, after entering the correct YAML statement, click __OK__ .

    ![Create from YAML](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/kairship/images/op002.png)

3. Return to the override policy list, and the newly created one is the first one by default. Click __â”‡__ on the right side of the list to edit YAML and perform delete operations.

    !!! note

        If you want to delete an override policy, it is recommended to remove the workload related to the policy first. 
        Once the override policy is deleted, all information related to the policy will be deleted. Please operate with caution.

### YAML example

Here is an example YAML for an override policy that you can use with a little modification.

```yaml
kind: OverridePolicy
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
   name: nginx-op
   namespace: default
   uid: 09f89bc4-c6bf-47b3-81bf-9e494b831aac
   resourceVersion: '856977'
   generation: 1
   creationTimestamp: '2022-09-21T10:30:40Z'
   labels:
     a:b
   annotations:
     shadow.clusterpedia.io/cluster-name:k-kairshiptest
spec:
   resourceSelectors:
     - apiVersion: apps/v1
       kind: Deployment
       namespace: default
       name: nginx
   overriders: {}
```

## Create Override Policy

Follow the steps below to create an override policy.

1. Go to the Namespace Scope menu and click the __Create Override Policy__ button.

2. Enter the form creation page. To create a complete override policy, you need to configure three parts: Basic Settings, Resource Quotas, and Override Policy.

    - Basic Settings: including name, multicloud namespace, labels and annotations. Where Name and Multicloud Namespace are required.

    - Resource Quotas: supports the selection of multicloud resources under the selected multicloud namespace for override configuration, and multicloud resources also support multiple selections.

    - Override Policy: support for adding Image/Command/Args/Plaintext and other Override configurations.

    ![Create OP](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/kairship/images/op003.png)

3. After completing the filling, click __OK__ to create successfully. It supports YAML update, form update, and delete operations for an override policy.

### Detailed Override Policy

Next, we will introduce the override policies in detail, which are divided into six types and support adding multiple override configurations:

1. Select ImageOverrider: Override configuration of image.

    1. Select a cluster

        Support Specify Clustes, Specify Regions, and Specify Labels to select the cluster.

        === "Specify Clustes"
         
            Directly select the specified cluster name

            ![Specify Clusters](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/kairship/images/op004.png)

        === "Specify Regions"
         
            Select clusters by regions, including:

            - Providers (a service provider that provides cluster infrastructure)
            - Regions (a collection of availability zones, referring to a specific geographic location where resources can be hosted, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chengdu, etc.)
            - Zones (the deployment area within the region, such as Shanghai Availability Zone 1, Shanghai Availability Zone 2...)
            - Also supports excluding a specified cluster from the selected clusters.

            ![Specify Regions](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/kairship/images/op005.png)

        === "Specify Labels"
         
            Select clusters by labels, support custom labels, and also support exclusion of specified clusters.

            ![Specify Labels](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/kairship/images/op006.png)

    2. Override configuration for mirroring the selected clusters

        | Field | Required | Description | Example |
        | ----- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
        | Component | Yes | Image component | Registry, Repository, Tag |
        | Operator | Yes | the operation on the image | add, remove, replace |
        | Value | No | When the Operator is __add__ or __replace__ , it cannot be empty, and it is empty by default; when the operator is __remove__ , leave it blank. | |
