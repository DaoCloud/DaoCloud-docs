# Update/Delete Multicloud Workloads

You can create a multi-cloud deployment either from an [image](deployment.md) or a [YAML file](yaml.md). Therefore, you can also update it with these two methods.

1. Click on `Multicloud Workloads` -> `Deployments` in the left navigation menu. Then, click on the `âµˆ` icon on the far right of the corresponding workload to display more options.

    - Select `Edit YAML` to update the deployment using YAML.
    - Select `Update` to update the deployment using a form.
    - Select `Delete` to directly delete the deployment.
    - Select `Pause` to temporarily stop the deployment from running.
    - Select `Restart` to restart the deployment.
