# Create Multicloud Deployment from Image

After [added a worker cluster](../cluster.md#_2) into a multi-cloud instance, you can create multi-cloud workloads or [convert existing workloads into multi-cloud workloads](promote.md).

This page will introduce how to create a multi-cloud deployment from an image. For the YAML method, see [Create Multicloud Deployment from YAML](yaml.md)

## Prerequisites

- [Create a multi-cloud instance](../instance/add.md)
- [Add at least one worker cluster to the multi-cloud instance](../cluster.md#_2)
- If you want to deploy workloads to specific clusters based on region, availability zone, or labels, you need to add region, availability zone, and label information to the clusters beforehand.

## Steps

Follow the steps below to create a multi-cloud deployment from an image.

1. Click on the name of the multi-cloud instance, then navigate to `Multi-Cloud Workloads` in the left navigation pane, and click on `Create from Image` in the top right corner.

2. Fill in the basic information as per the instructions provided.

    - Specify Clusters: Select the specific cluster to deploy the multi-cloud workload.
    - Specify Regions: Filter clusters based on the provider/region/availability zone. You can enable all three filters simultaneously.

        - `Exclude Clusters`: Exclude a specific cluster from the filtering result. The workload will not be deployed to the excluded cluster.
        - `Cluster Taint Tolerance`: After adding a taint to the cluster in the [Cluster](../cluster.md#_6) page, resources with that taint cannot be scheduled to that cluster. Enabling taint tolerance here allows resources with the corresponding taint to be scheduled to the selected cluster.
        - `Dynamic Regions`: Dynamically deploy workloads to clusters in different regions to ensure cross-region high availability.

    - Specify Labels: Deploy the workload to specific clusters based on labels.

        - You can add one or multiple cluster labels.
        - Operator - `In`: The node must contain the selected labels, and the label value must belong to the value group you defined. Multiple values are separated by `;`.
        - Operator - `Exists`: The node only needs to have the label and its value doesn't matter.

    - Auto Propagation: When enabled, it automatically detects ConfigMaps, Secrets, and other resources that the multi-cloud workload depends on, and propagates these resources to each selected deployment cluster.
    - Pods: Set the number of replicas for the multi-cloud workload.
    - Deployment Policies

        - `Duplicated`: Deploy the number of replicas set in the `Pods` field to each selected cluster. `Total Replicas = Pod number ✖️ Cluster number`
        - `Aggregated`: Distribute the number of replicas set in the `Pods` field to as few clusters as possible. `Total Replicas = Pod number`
        - `Dynamic Weight`: Dynamically distribute workloads subject to the available resources in each cluster. `Total Replicas = Pod number`

    !!! note

        - If cannot find your target cluster, you can either reduce filtering conditions or [add new worker clusters](../cluster.md#_2).
        - After setting the `Pods` and `Deployment Policies`, the total number of replicas to be deployed will be displayed below the selected policy.

3. Refer to the [container configuration](../../kpanda/user-guide/workloads/create-deployment.md#_4) to fill in the container settings.

4. Refer to the [advanced configuration](../../kpanda/user-guide/workloads/create-deployment.md#_6) to fill in the advanced settings.

    !!! note

        - If you don't need differentiated configurations, simply click `OK` in the lower right corner to complete the creation.
        - If you need differentiated configurations, click `Next` and refer to instructions below to add more settings.

5. Refer to the instructions below to fill in the differentiated configurations, and click `OK`.

    - `Default`: This refers to the general configuration filled in the previous steps and cannot be modified here.
    - If you need to modify the default configuration, you need to click `Previous` at the bottom of the page to return to the corresponding configuration environment and re-enter the information.
    - Below the default configuration, click on the `+` button and select a cluster to set differentiated configurations for that specific cluster, different from other clusters.
    - Clusters that do not have differentiated configurations will use the default configuration.
    - Currently, you can configure different container images, environment variables, labels, and annotations for different clusters.

You will be automatically redirected to the list of multi-cloud deployments. By clicking the "More Actions" button on the right side, you can edit the YAML of the workload, update/pause/restart/delete the workload.
