# Workspaces

Workspaces are a hierarchical mapping of resources designed for managing global resources in DCE 5.0. A workspace can be understood as a project within a department, and administrators map the relationship between departments and projects using folders and workspaces. For more detailed information about workspaces, refer to the [Workspace and Folder](../ghippo/user-guide/workspace/workspace.md) documentation.

## Considerations

- The current operating user should have Admin or Workspace Admin permissions. For more information on permissions, refer to the [Permission Management](../ghippo/user-guide/access-control/role.md) and [Workspace Permissions](../ghippo/user-guide/workspace/ws-permission.md) documentation.
- After binding a multicloud instance/namespace with a workspace, all worker clusters under the multicloud instance will automatically synchronize this binding, allowing users of the corresponding workspace to operate corresponding resources in the cluster.
- After binding, you can go to the __Workspace and Folder__ -> __Resource Group__ section in the Global Management module to view this resource. For more details, refer to the [Resource Quota](../ghippo/user-guide/workspace/quota.md#_1) documentation.
- Currently, one multicloud instance/namespace can only be bound to one workspace, creating a one-to-one mapping relationship.

    - This ensures stable matching of resources and permissions, preventing resource and permission conflicts.
    - In the future, we will support binding a multicloud instance or namespace as a shared resource to multiple workspaces. This feature is currently under development, so stay tuned.

## Bind/Unbind Workspace

In the Multicloud Management module, admin of the DCE 5.0 platform can bind multicloud instances or multicloud namespaces to a workspace.

After the binding, users of that workspace can operate instances or namespaces within their permission scope.

1. Click __Workspace__ in the upper-right corner of the homepage of the Multicloud Management module.

2. Check the binding status of multicloud instances/namespaces, then click the __âµ—__ action button and select __Bind Workspace__ or __Unbind Workspace__ as needed.

3. Select which workspace to bind when binding, or just confirm your action when unbinding.
