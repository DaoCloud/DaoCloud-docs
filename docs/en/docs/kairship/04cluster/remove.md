# Remove cluster

If you want to remove a cluster, you can click the `…` button on the right in the list of working clusters, and select `Remove` from the pop-up menu.



Enter the name of the cluster in the pop-up window, and click `Confirm to remove` after confirming that it is correct.



!!! note

    After the working cluster is removed, the cluster workload will no longer be managed by the multicloud orchestrator, and all the multicloud workloads currently distributed to this cluster will be automatically loaded on other managed clusters.
