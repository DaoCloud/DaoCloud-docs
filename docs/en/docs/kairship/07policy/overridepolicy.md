# OverridePolicy

Multicloud orchestration supports differentiated strategies, supports viewing the differentiated strategy list of the current instance and its associated multicloud resources on the interface, maintains, creates and edits differentiated strategy information in the form of YAML, and supports viewing the differentiated strategies of the current instance on the interface A list of policies and the multicloud resources associated with the current differentiated policy.

Differentiation policies define different configurations in multicloud and multi-cluster, which facilitates the management of deployment policies (Propagation Policy) and differentiation policies (Override Policy).

Follow the steps below to create a OverridePolicy.

        If you want to delete a differentiated policy, you need to remove the workload related to the policy first. After the deletion, all the information related to the policy will be deleted. Please proceed with caution.
