# PropagationPolicy

Multicloud orchestration supports viewing the deployment policy list of the current instance and its associated multicloud resources on the interface, supports creating and editing deployment policy information in YAML, and only provides a delete button for idle deployment policies.

Deployment policies define how resources are distributed across multicloud and multi-cluster.

Follow the steps below to create a PropagationPolicy.

1. After entering a multicloud instance, in the left navigation bar, click `Policy Management` -> `Deployment Policy`, and click the `Create with YAML` button in the upper right corner.

2. On the `Create with YAML` page, after entering the correct YAML statement, click `OK`.

3. Return to the deployment policy list, and the newly created one is the first one by default. Click `â‹®` on the right side of the list to edit YAML and perform delete operations.

    !!! note

        If you want to delete a deployment policy, you need to remove the workload related to the policy first. After the deletion, all the information related to the policy will be deleted. Please proceed with caution.

## YAML example

Here is an example YAML for a deployment policy that you can use with a little modification.

```yaml
kind: PropagationPolicy
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1

  name: nginx-propagation
  namespace: default

  generation: 1
  creationTimestamp: '2022-09-15T10:04:20Z'
  annotations:

  resourceSelectors:
    - apiVersion: apps/v1

        operator: Exists
        effect: NoExecute
        tolerationSeconds: 300
