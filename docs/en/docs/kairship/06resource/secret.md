# Multicloud Secret

A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive information such as a password, token, or Secret.
Such information may be placed in the Pod specification or in the image.
Using Secret means you don't need to include secret data in your application code.

Since Secrets can be created independently of the Pods that use them, there is less risk of exposing Secrets (and their data) during the workflow of creating, viewing, and editing Pods.
DCE and applications running in the cluster can also take additional precautions with Secrets, such as avoiding writing confidential data to non-volatile storage.

Secret is similar to ConfigMap but designed to hold secret data.

Two creation methods are currently provided: wizard creation and Create with YAML. This article takes wizard creation as an example, and follows the steps below.

1. After entering a multicloud instance, in the left navigation bar, click `Resource Management` -> `Multicloud Secret`, and click the `Create Secret` button in the upper right corner.

3. Back to the list of multicloud Secrets, the newly created one is the first one by default. Click `â‹®` on the right side of the list to edit YAML, update, export and delete Secret.

    !!! note

        If you delete a Secret, its related information will also be deleted, please operate with caution.
