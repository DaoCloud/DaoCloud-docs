# Multicloud service

Multicloud services are applications running on a group of Pods, which are exposed as network services one by one.
Using the DCE multicloud orchestration module, you can use unfamiliar service discovery mechanisms without modifying your applications.
DCE provides the IP address for the Pod running the service and provides the same DNS name for a group of Pods, which can be load balanced among these Pods.

Follow the steps below to manage multicloud services.

1. After entering a multicloud instance, in the left navigation bar, click `Resource Management` -> `Multicloud Service`, and click the `Create` button in the upper right corner.
