# What is Multicloud Management?

Cloud computing has been developing in China for nearly 15 years, and with the maturity of technology, enterprise are not satisfied with simply moving their applications to the cloud. Instead, more complex multicloud requirements have emerged. The development process of cloud computing from single cloud to multicloud is illustrated below:

At the early stage, enterprises simply migrated their applications to the cloud. However, now they want to select clouds and customize their own multicloud environment.

According to statistics, the current distribution of multicloud adoption by businesses choosing to the cloud are as follows:

| Cloud Solutions       | Market Share |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| multiple public clouds + multiple private clouds | 43% |
| multiple public clouds + one private cloud | 29% |
| one public cloud + multiple private clouds | 12% |
| one public cloud + one private cloud | 9% |
| one public cloud or one private cloud | 7% |

As the table shows, multicloud has become the mainstream in the market. This also explains why DaoCloud crafted the Multicloud Management module in DCE 5.0.

MultiCloud Management is an application-centric platform for efficiently managing applications across multiple clouds.
It allows centralized management of multicloud and hybrid-cloud environments, providing cross-cloud deployment, release, and operational components. Elastic scaling of applications based on cluster resources supports global load balancing, and it provides disaster recovery that fully addresses the disaster recovery problem for multicloud applications.
