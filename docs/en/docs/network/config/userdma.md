# Using RDMA in Workloads

This chapter mainly introduces how to configure and use RDMA resources in workloads.
DCE 5.0 provides three methods for RDMA passthrough. See [RDMA Usage Comparison](rdmatype.md) for details.

!!! note

    This chapter is based on the example of using RoCE network cards with SR-IOV. To facilitate RDMA testing, the configured image should be `docker.io/mellanox/rping-test`, and the sh command should be run to prevent the Pod from exiting abnormally during the operation. Please refer to the following content for details.

## Prerequisites

- [SpiderPool has been successfully deployed](../modules/spiderpool/install/install.md)
- [RDMA installation and preparation have been completed](../modules/spiderpool/install/rdmapara.md)
- [Multus CR has been created](multus-cr.md)
- [IP Pool has been created](./ippool/createpool.md)

## UI Operations

1. Log in to the platform UI, click `Container Management` -> `Cluster List` in the left navigation bar, find the corresponding cluster. Then, select `Deployments` in the left navigation bar and click `Create Image`.

1. On the `Create Deployment` page, use the image `docker.io/mellanox/rping-test`. Set `Replica` to `2` to deploy a group of cross-node Pods.

1. Fill in the `Basic Information` and enter the following information in the `Container Configuration`.

    - `Network Resource Parameters`:
      
        - When using RDMA based on Macvlan/VLAN CNI, the resource name is the custom name created in [RDMA Installation and Preparation](install/rdmapara.md) when creating Spiderpool. For more information, please refer to [Exposing RoCE Network Card based on Macvlan/IPVLAN](rdmapara.md/#exposing-roce-network-card-based-on-macvlan-ipvlan).

        - When using RDMA based on SRIOV CNI, the resource name is the `resourceName` defined in `SriovNetworkNodePolicy`. For more information, please refer to [Using RoCE Network Card based on SR-IOV](../modules/spiderpool/install/rdmapara.md#using-roce-network-card-based-on-sr-iov).

        The `spidernet.io/mellnoxrdma` in the example is an example of using RoCE network cards based on SR-IOV. The request and limit values are currently consistent, and the input value should not exceed the maximum available value.
        
    - `Run Command`: To prevent the Pod from starting and exiting abnormally, add the following run command:
    
        ```para
        - sh
        - -c
        - |
          ls -l /dev/infiniband /sys/class/net
          sleep 1000000
       ```
    
1. After completing the information input on the `Container Configuration` and `Service Configuration` pages, go to `Advanced Configuration` and click to configure `Container Network`.

1. Select the [created Multus CR](multus-cr.md), turn off the fixed IP pool creation function, select the [created IP Pool](ippool/createpool.md), and click `OK` to complete the creation.
