# Hosted registry

The microservices engine supports hosting the Nacos registry, which creates a new NacOS-type registry from scratch in the microservices governance Center and can be fully managed through the microservices Governance Center. The hosted registry supports more operations than [Integrated Registry](../integrated/index.md), including viewing the basic information of the registry instance, microservice namespace management, microservice list, microservice configuration list, monitoring alerts, log viewing, plug-in center, and more.

## Create

!!! note

    - Install the skoala-init component in the ** skoala-system ** namespace of the target cluster. For details, see [Manage Helm App](../../../kpanda/user-guide/helm/helm-app.md).
    - If the selected group does not have a ** skoala-system ** namespace, refer to [Create Namespace](../../../kpanda/user-guide/namespaces/createns.md) to create a namespace named ** skoala-system **.

The steps to create a hosted registry are as follows.

1. Click __Traditional Microservices__ -> __Hosted Registry__ in the left navigation bar, and then click
   `Create Hosted Registry` in the upper right corner of the page to enter the page for creating the hosting registry instance.

   ![create hosted registry](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/skoala/images/create01.png)

2. Enter the configuration information.

    What should be noted is:

    - Registry name: Letters, numbers, and delimiters (-) are supported. The registry name cannot be changed after it is created.
    - Deployment location: The system automatically verifies whether the skoala-init component is installed in the **skoala-system** namespace of the selected group.

        - If it is not installed, the registry cannot be created. Follow the prompts on the page to install the component.
        - The deployment location cannot be changed after the registry is created.

    - Resource configuration: You can directly set `1Core2G`, `2Core4G`, or customize the resource quota.

        -  `1Core2G` indicates that the request value and limit value of CPU are 2 cores respectively, the request value and limit value of memory are 2 G respectively, and so on.

        - Click __Recommended Quotas__ to see throughput (TPS) for mainstream specifications such as 2 Core 4 GiB, 4 Core 8 GiB, and 8 Core 16 GiB.

    - Access mode: If `NodePort` is selected, the registry can be accessed externally through **Service port + destination port**. If `Internal Access` is selected, the registry can be accessed through service ports only in the cluster where the registry resides. The default service port is 8848.
    - Deployment mode: If high availability mode is selected, the number of nodes must be at least three. In the production environment, the `High Availability` mode is recommended.

    - Data persistence: External storage is recommended.

        - No external storage is used: The data is stored in the Pod file system where Nacos resides. Data is lost after the Pod restarts, so external storage is recommended.
        - Using the database: Enter the name, address, port, username, and password of the database

3. At the bottom of the page click __OK__ .

    If the operation is correct, a message indicating that the registry is created successfully is displayed in the upper right corner of the page. The __hosted registry List__ page displays the new registry instance.

    ![click ok](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/en/docs/skoala/images/create05.png)

!!! info

    - A new registry takes a period of time to initialize and is in the "Starting" state. After the initialization, the system enters the Running state.
    - You can click the registry name to view basic information such as the cluster/namespace, running status, resource quota, service port, storage configuration, and node list.

## Update

1. In the __Managed Registry List__ page choose need to update the registry, on the right side click __ⵗ__ and select __Edit__ .

2. Update the registry configuration, then click __OK__ at the bottom of the page.

    !!! warning

        - Modify the StorageClass/database. After the storage location is changed, the previous data will not be migrated.
        - The managed registry name and deployment location are not editable.

## View

On the Managed Registry list page, locate the registry instance for which you want to view details and click the instance name to go to the Basic information page.

In basic information page to view the registry `Basic Info`, `Governance Info` (need to open service governance features), `Node List`, and `Data Persistence` information. Health Status is the part of the registry instance information that reflects the status of the registry instance.

**Related operation**：

- Restart the registry instance: Click __Restart__ in the upper right corner of the page to restart the entire managed registry instance.

## Delete

1. In the __Hosted Registries__ page select need to delete the registry, on the right side click __ⵗ__ and select __Delete__ .

!!! note


    - Remove: The registry is removed from the DCE 5.0 microservice engine. The original registry and data are not deleted. You can access the registry again later.
    - Delete: Deletes the registry and all the data in it. The registry cannot be used again. You need to create a new registry.
