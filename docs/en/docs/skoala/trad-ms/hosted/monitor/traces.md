# Tracing

DCE 5.0 supports service-level tracing and query to view the link latency distribution of each micro-service and quickly locate faults when faults occur.

!!! note

You shall [install insight-agent](../../../../insight/quickstart/install/install-agent.md) before using the monitor function.

For more details, see [Insight-->Trace Query](../../../../insight/user-guide/trace/trace.md).
