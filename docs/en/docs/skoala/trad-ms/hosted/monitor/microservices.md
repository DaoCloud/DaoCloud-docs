# Microservice monitoring

The Microservice engine provides a full range of Grafana monitoring capabilities covering various microservices, system components, and service invocation traces. The microservice monitoring feature can provide monitoring information of each microservice in the managed registry, including service response time, concurrency, abnormal QPS, blocked QPS, passed QPS, successful QPS and other dimensions.

!!! note

    To use the monitoring functionality in the cluster, you need to install the `insight-agent` component. You can follow the installation instructions for the `insight-agent` component by referring to the documentation provided at the following path: `insight/quickstart/install/install-agent.md`.

To view microservice monitoring, perform the following steps:

1. Go to the Microservices Engine module and click the name of the target registry.

2. In the left navigation bar, click __Monitoring__ -> __Microservices__ .

3. Select a microservice namespace, service, instance, and resource to view the microservice monitoring data in the namespace.

    > Click the dashboard name to further view or share the monitoring information. You can switch the statistics time window and refresh period in the upper right corner of the page.
