# Microservice management

After [integrating a registry](index.md), you can manage the microservices in the registry. Microservice management refers to viewing the microservices in the registry.

!!! note

    An access-based registry center only supports basic management operations. For more complex management scenarios, it is recommended to create a [hosted registry center](../hosted/index.md) to perform more advanced operations.

1. Click the name of the target registry on the __In__ page.

2. Click __Microservice Management__ in the left navigation bar to view the list of microservices and basic information.

    On the current page, you can copy the name of the microservice and view all microservices in the current registry, as well as the namespace, instance, and request statistics of each microservice.
