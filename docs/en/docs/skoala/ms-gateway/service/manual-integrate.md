# Manually access the service

The successfully added service will appear on the service list page, and you can also select the service in the list as the target backend service when adding an API. The microservice gateway supports adding services through manual access and automatic discovery. This page describes how to manually access the service.

**Prerequisites**

You need to add the corresponding service source in the source management <!--to-be-supplemented link--> in advance, so that you can select the corresponding service source type when manually accessing the service.

## Access service
