# Feature Overview

DCE 5.0 Microservice Engine has the following feature capabilities:

## Microservice Registration and Discovery

Unified management of traditional microservices and cloud-native microservices, enabling a smooth transition from traditional microservice ecosystems to cloud-native environments.

- Supports creating a Nacos management center to manage microservice namespaces, traffic governance, configuration management, service tracing, and monitoring.
- Supports integration with four types of traditional microservice registration centers: Eureka, ZooKeeper, Nacos, and Consul.
- Supports integration with two types of cloud-native microservice registration centers: Kubernetes and Service Mesh.

## Microservice Traffic Governance

In terms of traffic governance, we adopt online traffic governance solutions, which can be quickly integrated with
mainstream open-source microservice frameworks to address pain points in different production scenarios using Sentinel and Mesh.

- Supports the use of Sentinel to govern east-west traffic in traditional microservices through traffic shaping,
  circuit breaking, degradation, hotspots, system protection, authorization, and cluster flow control rules.
- Supports the use of service mesh capabilities to govern microservice traffic within the mesh through
  virtual services, destination rules, and gateway rules.
- Supports the use of Istio to govern east-west traffic for service ports through load balancing,
  circuit breaking, outlier detection, rewriting, fault injection, retries, timeouts, and global rate limiting rules.
- Supports cloud-native microservice governance by extending capabilities through the creation and configuration of Wasm plugins.
- Supports traffic management in traffic lane mode.

## Microservice Configuration Center

The Nacos-managed registration center can serve as a configuration manager for microservices.
It can extract common configurations from different projects and centrally manage them,
or apply different configurations to the same project for differentiated management.

- Isolates configuration files based on microservice namespaces and groups.
- Supports dynamic configuration updates with the `@RefreshScope` annotation.
- Manages historical versions of configuration files, supports version diff comparison,
  and provides one-click rollback to specific versions.
- Supports querying the current configuration's listeners and MD5 checksum.
- Provides sample code for easy consumption of the configuration by novice users, reducing the learning curve.

## Microservice Gateway

The microservice gateway plays a vital role in managing and controlling the north-south traffic of microservices. It provides capabilities such as API management, interface rate limiting, various security authentication strategies, blacklisting/whitelisting, routing, and MockAPI. It also provides enterprise-level high-performance and highly scalable cloud service capabilities.

- Multi-gateway management: Native support for managing multiple cluster and namespace gateway instances in the [Container Management](../../kpanda/intro/index.md) module, supporting full lifecycle management of gateway instances.
- API policy management: Graphical interface for API CRUD operations and configuration of API policies, such as load balancing, path rewriting, timeout configuration, retry mechanism, request/response header rewriting, WebSocket, local rate limiting, and health checks while ensuring that the capabilities of native APIs are not affected.
- Monitoring and alerting: The microservice gateway is automatically configured with monitoring, alerting, and other functions during deployment. Each gateway comes with comprehensive resource monitoring and gateway business monitoring capabilities.

## Plugin Center

We provide a wide range of feature-rich plugins, including security hardening, traffic management, and data caching,
to enhance your user experience. In addition, we support custom plugins, allowing you to configure them according to
your specific needs. All plugins can be easily enabled or disabled with a simple one-click operation,
ensuring convenience and efficiency.

- Supports plugins for JWT authentication, security authentication, and global rate limiting,
  allowing you to customize multiple gateway API authentication strategies and quickly integrate
  them into your gateway instances.
- Supports user-defined creation of Wasm plugins.
