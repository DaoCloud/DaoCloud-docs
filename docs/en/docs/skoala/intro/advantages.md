# Competitiveness

DaoCloud Microservice Engine provides a set of easy-to-use, practical and high-performance microservice governance capabilities, such as registration and discovery, east-west and north-south traffic governance, configuration management, API management, and multiple gateways. Microservice Engline helps you to steadily and safely upgrade traditional microservice architecture to cloud native microservice architecture.

Microservice Engline has the following advantages over its counterparts:

- One-stop Management

    Microservice Engline is a comprehensive microservice platform. No bother to select and integrate several tools, just with Microservice Engline you can perform service registration and discovery, configuration management, traffic governance, tracing, monitoring & alerting, gateway management, API management, domain management, service integration, and many other operations about microservice management.

- Simple Migration

    Microservice Engline is fully compatible with Nacos, Envoy and contour open-source projects. You can migrate your services from self-build Nacos, Envoy and contour to Microservice Engline directly, no need to make any code changes.

- Easy Transition

    Microservice Engline can manage both traditional and cloud native microservices. You can integrate traditional registries (Zookeeper, Eureka, Nacos, Consul) and cloud native registries (Kubernetes, Service Mesh) into DME. You can also create a Nacos registry in Microservice Engline and enable Mesh plugin to change traditional microservices to cloud native ones, no need to change service codes.

- Open and Compatible

    The microservice engine supports both traditional and cloud native service registries.
    It also supports popular open-source microservice frameworks such as Spring Cloud and Dubbo,
    as well as open-source gateway components like Envoy and Contour.
    In addition, it can be combined with other modules in [DCE 5.0](../../dce/index.md)
    such as multicloud management, middleware, service mesh, and workbench to achieve
    more customization and fine-grained functionality.

- Visualization

    Microservice Engline provides user-friendly UI by encapsulating open-source envoy and contour and improve them with self-developed features. It also offers visualized topology and traces to help better understand microservice status and quickly locate errors. Microservice Engline lower the barrier of microservice governance, making it easier to fresh hands to get started.
