# Product advantages

The microservice engine provided by "DaoCloud Taoke" includes two modules: microservice governance center and microservice gateway, providing a set of simple, practical and high-performance microservice governance such as microservice registration discovery, traffic governance, configuration management, and gateway API Ability to help stabilize the upgrade from traditional microservice architecture to cloud-native microservice architecture.

Compared with other similar products, the microservice engine provided by "DaoCloud" has the following advantages:

=== "One-stop governance"

    Provides functions such as service registration discovery, configuration management, traffic management, link tracking, indicator monitoring, gateway management, API management, domain name management, monitoring alarms, gateway policies, etc., to meet the management needs of each stage in the microservice lifecycle and realize one-stop governance.

=== "Senseless Migration"

    It is fully compatible with the Nacos open source registration center and Envoy and contour open source gateways, and supports the migration from self-built services to the "DaoCloud Daoke" microservice engine on the premise of zero code transformation. Traditional microservices can be connected to the microservice engine through the registration center without any modification, and then realize functions such as traffic management, configuration management, link tracking, and indicator monitoring.

=== "Smooth Transition"

    Unified management of traditional micro-services and cloud-native micro-services, support for access to traditional registration centers (Zookeeper, Eureka, Nacos) and cloud-native registration centers (Kubernetes, Service Mesh) types of registration centers, to realize the transition from traditional micro-service ecology to cloud-native micro-services The smooth transition of the service ecosystem helps enterprises move towards cloud nativeization.

=== "Open Compatibility"

    The microservice engine supports traditional and cloud music registration centers, as well as mainstream open source microservice frameworks such as Spring Cloud and Dubbo, and open source gateway components such as Envoy, Sentinel, and Contour. In addition, it can be freely combined with [DCE 5.0](../../dce/what-is-dce.md) modules such as multicloud orchestration, data service middleware, service mesh, and application workbench to achieve more Customized and refined functions.

=== "Visual interface and data"

    Expose simple and easy-to-use interactive pages through functional encapsulation, support all operations through a simple and intuitive UI interface, reduce operational difficulty, and truly realize various management operations in the entire lifecycle of microservices with a click of a mouse.
