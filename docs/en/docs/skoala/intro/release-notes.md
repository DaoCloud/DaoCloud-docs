!!! note

    Important: When the Microservice Engine version is greater than `v0.24.2`, there are incompatible updates
    for versions `v0.24.2` and earlier. Since the gateway involves changes in the open-source component
    repository addresses, it is necessary to manually delete the old `gateway-api-admission-xxxxx` Job
    before performing the upgrade. Then proceed with the normal upgrade process.

## 2023-08-03

### v0.26.2

#### Fixed

- **Fixed** Issue with detection of `Consul` registry connectivity
- **Fixed** Issue with gateway restarting due to abnormal application of plugins
- **Fixed** Issue with abnormal configuration of gateway verification plugins
- **Fixed** Issue with abnormal editing of cluster flow control rules in `Sentinel`

!!! note

    Important: Starting from Microservice Engine version `v0.24.2`, there is an incompatible update for versions `v0.24.2` and earlier. This is because the gateway involves a change in the address of the open-source component repository. Therefore, before updating, you need to manually delete the existing `gateway-api-admission-xxxxx` Job and then proceed with the normal upgrade process.
