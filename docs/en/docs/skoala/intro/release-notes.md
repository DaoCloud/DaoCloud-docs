!!! note "Important Note"

    When the Microservice Engine version is greater than `v0.24.2`, there are incompatible updates
    for versions `v0.24.2` and earlier. Since the gateway involves changes in the open-source component
    repository addresses, it is necessary to manually delete the old `gateway-api-admission-xxxxx` Job
    before performing the upgrade. Then proceed with the normal upgrade process.

## 2023-08-03

!!! note "Important Note"

    Starting from Microservice Engine version `v0.24.2`, there is an incompatible update for versions `v0.24.2` and earlier. This is because the gateway involves a change in the address of the open-source component repository. Therefore, before updating, you need to manually delete the existing `gateway-api-admission-xxxxx` Job and then proceed with the normal upgrade process.
