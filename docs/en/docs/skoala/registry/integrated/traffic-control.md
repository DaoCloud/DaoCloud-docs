# Microservice Governance

Microservice governance mainly refers to Istio-based mesh service traffic governance. The [Service mesh](../../../mspider/01Intro/WhatismSpider.md) module of DCE 5.0 is integrated in the microservice engine, which supports three ways to govern the mesh through virtual services, target rules, and gateway rules Serve.

!!! note

    - This feature is only supported for Mesh-type registries.
    - Registries of the Kubernetes/Zookeeper/Nacos/Eureka type will not display the `Microservice Governance` operation on the left navigation bar.

For more information about microservice governance, please refer to [Service Mesh --> Traffic Governance](../../../mspider/03UserGuide/02TrafficGovernance/README.md).
