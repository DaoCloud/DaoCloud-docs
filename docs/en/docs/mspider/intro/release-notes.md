# Service Mesh Release Notes

This page lists all the Release Notes for each version of Service Mesh,
providing convenience for users to learn about the evolution path and feature changes.

*[mspider]: Internal development codename for DaoCloud Service Mesh

## 2025-01-25

### v0.34.0

- **Fixed** an issue where the mesh gateway load balancing IP could not be queried.
- **Fixed** a problem where the installation parameters for the Ingress gateway were confused when both managed cluster and workload cluster roles were present.
- **Updated** Istio v1.23 set as an experimental version, with 1.22 being the default recommended version.

## Notes on Upgrading Service Mesh to Istio 1.23+

!!! note

    Affected Range:
    If the Istio version is lower than 1.23 and a mesh gateway instance has been created, you need to upgrade to Istio 1.23.
    If Istio is lower than 1.23 but no mesh gateway instance has been created, this upgrade will not affect you.

### Background

The Istio community announced the deprecation of the In-Cluster Operator in [1.23](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2024/in-cluster-operator-deprecation-announcement/) and it will be fully deprecated in 1.24.
DCE 5.0's service mesh uses the Istio In-Cluster Operator, so to ensure that versions 1.23 and later of Istio can be installed correctly, we have developed and open-sourced the [Pluma Operator](https://github.com/pluma-tools/pluma-operator).
When the Istio version in the service mesh is 1.23 or higher, the Operator will automatically switch from the Istio In-Cluster Operator to the Pluma Operator.

### Upgrade Changes

One major change with replacing the In-Cluster Operator with the Pluma Operator is that Istio component installations will shift from being managed by the Operator to being installed using Helm standard methods. This means that certain resources will undergo changes during the upgrade.

### Component Update Details

After upgrading to version 1.23, the following components will be affected:

- The `mspider` and `istio` components under `istio-system`.
- The mesh gateway installed through Mspider.

### Mesh Gateway Upgrade Procedure

!!! note

    Failure to perform the current upgrade will result in a disruption of north-south traffic.  

The most critical part of the upgrade is the data plane traffic, specifically the gateway, as the Helm standard installation brings changes to the templates. The gateway's labels change, which can prevent Pluma from properly upgrading the gateway. Thus, it is necessary to handle this in advance.  

Since Kubernetes does not allow updating `Deployment` selectorLabels, it is necessary to delete and recreate the labels:

1. Create a new gateway and customize the `app` and `istio` labels:

    ```yaml
    app: $gateway_name
    Istio: $gateway_name
    ```

2. Modify the corresponding Gateway Policy CRD to bind the new gateway and migrate traffic to the new gateway.

3. Delete the old gateway that does not conform to the upgraded template.

- **Improved** the Helm image rendering template. The image structure is now split into three parts: registry/repository:tag.

#### Fixes

- **Fixed** an issue where it was not compatible with the grpcgateway-accept-language header (equivalent to HTTP's Accept-Language), resulting in the inability to switch between Chinese and English modes correctly. It is now compatible with both Accept and Accept-Language modes.
- **Fixed** an issue where upstream could not push due to shadow clone code when synchronizing OpenAPI.
- **Fixed** an issue where Istio resources with **.** could not be updated.
- **Fixed** an issue where istio-proxy could not start normally in version 1.17.1.
- **Fixed** an issue where the ingress gateway lacked a name, causing the merge to fail and preventing deployment.
- **Fixed** an issue where the service address could not be searched.
- **Fixed** an issue where Istio resources with **.** could not be updated.
- **Fixed** a previous issue with controller memory leak.
- **Fixed** an issue where add/delete cluster logic sometimes did not trigger correctly.
- **Fixed** an issue where istio-system might be mistakenly deleted in managed mode.
- **Fixed** an issue where the ingress gateway lacked a name, causing the merge to fail and preventing deployment.
- **Fixed** an issue where, when global injection is turned on, updating the mesh may cause the istio-operator pod to be injected, leading to mesh creation failure.
- **Fixed** an issue where the service and WorkloadShadow association did not have a cleanup logic, causing services to be incorrectly bound to workloads.
- **Fixed** an issue that caused the virtual cluster to be synchronized to Mspider, leading to access failure.
- **Fixed** a typo in the wasm plugin image address in relok8s.
- **Fixed** the default repository error in TrafficLane.

#### Removals

- **Removed** the logic for synchronizing global clusters to the mesh.
- **Deprecated** the logic of the Deployment Controller.
- **Deprecated** ui.version parameter, replaced by the ui.image.tag parameter to set the front-end version.

## 2023-03-30

### v0.14.0

#### New Features

- **Added** CloudShell related API definitions
- **Added** implementation for updating service labels
- **Added** service list and details to return labels
- **Added** CloudShell related implementations
- **Added** service list now supports querying service labels
- **Added** a new API for updating service labels

#### Improvements

- **Improved** mcpc controller startup logic to avoid situations where the working cluster is not registered correctly
- **Improved** WorkloadShadow cleanup logic to trigger on event rather than on a timer. It will now clean up when the controller starts or detects changes in the working cluster. When WorkloadShadow changes, self-health checks will trigger cleanup if the corresponding workload does not exist.
- **Improved** mcpc controller startup logic to prevent issues with incorrect registration of the working cluster
- **Upgraded** Insight API to version v0.14.7
- **Upgraded** ckube to support complex conditional queries for labels
- **Removed** the Helm upgrade time limit

#### Fixes

- **Fixed** an issue where the interface would not display when the east-west gateway is not ready
- **Fixed** an issue where multi-cloud interconnection would automatically register the east-west gateway LB IP, potentially causing internal network anomalies (removed the label `topology.istio.io/network` from the east-west gateway instance, which would automatically register the east-west gateway)
- **Fixed** the error during cluster migration with the east-west gateway (unable to modify instance labels; if component labels need to be modified, components must be deleted and rebuilt)
- **Fixed** an issue that caused Mesh binding to workspace services to fail (the interface displayed success)
- **Fixed** an issue of orphaned namespaces in the virtual cluster due to exceptions, adding self-check and cleanup behavior when starting mcpc-controller
- **Fixed** an issue of API failing to push mesh configurations due to controller updating the mesh
- **Fixed** an issue where ServicePort's TargetPort was not set correctly when creating a managed mesh
- **Fixed** the incorrect override issue with `GlobalMesh.Status.MeshVersion`
- **Fixed** an issue where mcpc-controller could not enable debug mode
- **Fixed** an issue where mcpc-controller could not trigger cluster deletion events
- **Fixed** an issue where deleting a Mesh and then recreating a Mesh with the same name would prevent proper creation of the Mesh (hosted proxy could not be updated correctly)
- **Fixed** an issue where mcpc controller did not correctly modify the service of istiod-remote in certain cases

## 2023-02-28

#### Fixes

- **Fixed** an issue where some components were not updated after a mesh upgrade

- **Fixed** an issue where managed clusters could not act as working clusters
