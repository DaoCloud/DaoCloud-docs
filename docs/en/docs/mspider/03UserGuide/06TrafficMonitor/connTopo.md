## Service indicator data information

Click any service, and the sidebar will pop up to display service-related indicators based on the protocol type:

- HTTP service: request rate (RPM), error rate (%), average delay (ms)

- TCP service: number of connections (number), receiving throughput (B/S), sending throughput (B/S)

## health status

The health status is used to reflect the status information of services and connections, which are divided into normal, warning, abnormal and unknown, and judged by comparing the error rate and delay index data.

- OK (gray): error rate = 0 and latency does not exceed 100 ms

- Warning (orange): 0 < error rate <= 5% or 100 ms < delay <= 200 ms

- Abnormal (red): Error rate > 5% or latency > 200 ms

- Unknown (dotted line): no metric data is available
