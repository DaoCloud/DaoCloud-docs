# Authorization policy

The authorization policy is similar to a four-layer to seven-layer "firewall". Like a traditional firewall, it analyzes and matches the data flow, and then executes corresponding actions. The authorization policy applies whether the request is from internal or external.

Service mesh provides two creation methods: wizard and YAML. The specific steps to create through the wizard are as follows:

1. In the left navigation bar, click `Security Governance` -> `Authorization Policy`, and click the `Create` button in the upper right corner.
