# Virtual service parameter configuration

This page describes the parameter configuration when creating and editing a **Virtual Service**.

## Basic configuration

| UI element | YAML field | description |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------ ------------------------------------------ |
| Name | metadata.name | Required. Virtual service name. <br />Format requirements: lowercase letters, numbers and dashes (-), must start with a lowercase letter and end with a lowercase letter or number, up to 63 characters. |
| Namespace | metadata.namespace | Required. The namespace to which the virtual service belongs. In the same namespace, request identity authentication cannot have the same name. |
| Application Scope |spec.gateways | Required. The scope of virtual service application includes two types:<br />- specified gateway rules (multiple can be added), which can be used to expose internal services of the grid;<br />- valid for all sidecars (-mesh). |
| Owning service |spec.hosts | Required. The service object of the application virtual service can include three types:<br />-registration service from the Kubernetes registry;<br />-registration service from the service entry;<br />-service domain name. |

## Routing configuration

Multiple routing rules can be added, and the execution order is from top to bottom, and the routing rules ranked first take effect first.

### HTTP Routing

Multiple HTTP routing rules can be dragged and sorted, any route can be collapsed, and only the route name is displayed.

#### Basic Information

| UI Elements | YAML Fields | Description |
| -------- | --------------- | --------------------- --------------------------------------- |
| Route Name | spec.http.-name | Required. http route name. <br />Format requirements: lowercase letters, numbers and dashes (-), must start with a lowercase letter and end with a lowercase letter or number, up to 63 characters. |

#### Routing matching rules

required. The YAML field is `spec.http.-name.match`.

To match the request through URI path, port, etc., multiple rules can be added, and the order of execution is from top to bottom, and the top matching rule is used first.

| UI Elements | YAML Fields | Description |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | --------- -------------------------------------------------- -|
| Match URI | spec.http.-name.match.uri | Optional. There are three matching methods for matching the URI path of the request: <br /> - exact (exact): the field completely matches <br /> - prefix (prefix): matches the field prefix <br /> - regular (regex) : match based on RE2-style regular expressions |
| match port | spec.http.-name.match.port | optional. Match the requested port. |
| Match header | spec.http.-name.match.header | Required. Matching the HTTP header of the request also supports three matching methods:<br />-exact (exact): the field completely matches<br />-prefix (prefix): matches the field prefix<br />-regular ( regex): matching based on RE2-style regular expressions |

#### Routing target/redirect rule

The functions of `routing target` and `redirection` are mutually exclusive functions, and only one of them can be selected in a `HTTP routing rule`.

!!! note

     When the user turns on the `Proxy` switch, this item and related content will be grayed out.

**time out**

| UI Elements | YAML Fields | Description |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- ----------------------------------------------- |

**Retry**

| UI Elements | YAML Fields | Description |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | -- -------------------------------------------------- -------- |

| Number of retries | spec.http.-name.retries.attempts | Optional. The number of retries for a request that returns an exception. The default retry interval is 25ms. <br />When both the retry and timeout functions are enabled, the product of the number of retries, the timeout of retries, and the timeout period takes effect, whichever is the shortest, so the actual number of retries may be less than the set value. |
| retry timeout | spec.http.-name.retries.perTryTimeout | Optional. The timeout length of each retry is the same as the timeout function setting (http.route.timeout) by default. Input format: number + unit (s, m, h, ms). |

| Fault Injection | spec.http.-name.fault | Optional. Disabled by default. <br />The fault injection function is used to inject faults into the target service at the application layer, and can provide two types of faults: "delay" and "termination". When using fault injection, timeout and retry functions cannot be enabled. |
| Delay duration | spec.http.-name.delay.delay.fixedDelay | Required. The length of time that the request response can be delayed Input format: number + unit (s, m, h, ms). |

**Proxy Virtual Service**

The YAML field is `spec.http.-name.delegate`, which is off by default.

- The virtual service proxy function can split the routing configuration into two virtual services, master and slave. The master virtual service completes the basic settings and matching rules, and the proxy virtual service completes the specific routing rules.

- After the proxy function is enabled, only the route matching of the main virtual service takes effect, and the routing matching rules of the proxy virtual service do not need to be set.

- The routing rules of the proxy virtual service will be combined with the routing rules of the main virtual service.

- The proxy function does not support nesting, and only the main virtual service can enable the proxy function.

- Proxies are not configurable when the virtual service has "route target/redirect" configured.
