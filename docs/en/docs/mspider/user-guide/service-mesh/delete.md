When users no longer need the mesh governance service, they can use the delete operation.
Deleting a mesh requires users to complete a series of prerequisite operations
before activating the __Delete__ button in the dialog box.

    After performing the delete operation, the mesh cannot be recovered. If you want to manage it again, you need to recreate the mesh.
