| Category  | Parameters                    | Description                                        | Calculation Method                                         |

| General             | Global Request Volume                   | "Global Request Volume" represents the total request volume in the entire service mesh. Ops/s denotes the number of operations or requests executed per second. In Istio, this metric is typically used to assess the overall traffic in the service mesh. | OPS/s = Total Operations / Time Period (seconds)               |
|                     | Global Success Rate (non-5xx responses) |                                                                  | Global Success Rate (Non-5xx Responses) = (Total Requests - 5xx Responses) / Total Requests * 100 |
|                     | 4xxs                                    | 4xxs represent client errors, indicating potential issues with the request (e.g., 404 indicates not found). | ops/s = Number of 4xx responses received per second              |
|                     | 5xxs                                    | 5xxs represent server errors, indicating that the server failed to handle valid requests correctly (e.g., 500 indicates internal server error). | ops/s = Number of 5xx responses received per second              |

|                     | Service Entries                         | Measures the growth trend of Service Entries over a specific time range. By observing changes in Service Entries, it is possible to quickly understand the dynamic changes in services, which helps identify potential issues. | max(Service Entries && and) - max(Service Entries && delete)   |
