Services are represented by circles, and the color of the circle indicates the health status of the service:

- Healthy (Gray): Error rate = 0 and latency does not exceed 100 ms.
- Warning (Orange): 0 < Error rate <= 5% or 100 ms < Latency <= 200 ms.
- Critical (Red): Error rate > 5% or latency > 200 ms.
- Unknown (Dotted Line): No metric data available.

## Service Metrics Information

Click any service to open a sidebar that displays relevant metrics based on the protocol type:

- HTTP Protocol: Error Rate (%), Request Rate (RPM), Average Latency (ms)
- TCP Protocol: Connection Count, Receive Throughput (B/s), Send Throughput (B/s)
