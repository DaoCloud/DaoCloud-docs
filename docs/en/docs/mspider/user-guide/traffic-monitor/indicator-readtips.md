# Monitoring Dashboard Guide

The service mesh generates traffic monitoring dashboards for each instance based on the open-source Grafana Dashboard provided by Istio.

The dashboards primarily present the following dimensions:

- Global Monitoring: Displays overall information about the instance, including policy count, services, and workloads.
- Performance Monitoring: Emphasizes system resource performance of the instance and resource consumption by sidecar proxies.
- Service Monitoring: Focuses on traffic and workload status from a service perspective.
- Workload Monitoring: Provides resource consumption and business load data from a workload perspective.

## Guide to Reading Charts

Taking performance monitoring as an example, the charts provide monitoring data for various metrics. The presentation formats include numerical values, graphs, and tables.
