# Request Authentication

This authentication mode can be used when an external user initiates a request for mesh internal services. In this mode, request encryption is implemented using JSON Web Token (JWT).
Each request authentication needs to configure an [Authorization Policy](./authorize.md).

All workloads labeled __app: httpbin__ require JWT authentication. Examples are as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: RequestAuthentication
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: foo
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpbin
  jwtRules:
  - issuer: "issuer-foo"
    jwksUri: https://example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
```

Service Mesh provides two creation methods: wizard wizard and YAML. The specific steps to create through the wizard are as follows:

1. On the left navigation bar, click __Security__ -> __Request Authentication__ , and click the __Create__ button in the upper right corner.
