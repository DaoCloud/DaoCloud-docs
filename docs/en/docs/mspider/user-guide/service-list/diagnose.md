# One-click Diagnosis and Repair

DCE 5.0 service mesh has built-in one-click diagnosis and repair functions for managed services, which can be operated through a graphical interface.

1. Enter a specific Service Mesh and click __Service Management__ -> __Service List__ .
   In the __Diagnose Config__ column, next to services with an __Abnormal__ status,
   the word __Diagnose__ will appear. Click __Diagnose__.

2. A diagnosis popup will appear on the right-hand side. Follow the built-in checklist for inspection.
   Green checkmarks indicate that the item has <span style="color:green">Passed</span>, while red crosses indicate items that is <span style="color:red">Not Passed</span> and need to be repaired.

    Check the items that have <span style="color:red">Not Passed</span> and click the __One-Click Repair__ button.
    You can click __Rediagnose__ to refresh the checklist, and the repair is usually
    completed within a few minutes.

   <span style="color:green">Passed</span>. Click __Next__.
