# Product advantages

Here are the advantages of DCE 5.0 service mesh compared to other products.

- easy to use

    There is no need to modify any business code or manually install agents, just enable the service mesh function to experience rich non-intrusive service governance capabilities.

- Strategic intelligent routing and elastic traffic management

    Supports configuring load balancing, service routing, fault injection, circuit breaking and other governance rules for services. Combined with a one-stop management system; provides real-time, visualized micro-service traffic management; supports non-intrusive intelligent traffic management, and can perform dynamic intelligent routing and elastic traffic management without any modification of the application.

    - Routing rules such as weight, content, TCP/IP, etc.

    - HTTP sessions are maintained to meet the demands of business processing continuity.

    - Current limiting and fusing to achieve stable and reliable links between services.

    - Network persistent connection management reduces resource loss and improves network throughput.

    - Service security certification: certification, authentication, audit, etc., providing the cornerstone of service security.

- Graphical application panorama topology, visualized traffic management

    The service mesh provides visual traffic monitoring, including information such as link information, service abnormal response, and long response delay, and comprehensively displays business operation status through charts and topologies.

    The service mesh can combine application operation and maintenance management and application performance management services to provide detailed microservice-level traffic monitoring, abnormal response traffic reports, and call chain information, enabling faster and more accurate location of problems.

- Enhanced performance, increased reliability

    The service mesh control plane and data plane are more reliable and performance optimized based on the community version.

- Multicloud, multi-cluster, multi-infrastructure

    Provides an O&M-free hosting control plane, provides multicloud and multi-cluster global unified service governance, security, and service operation monitoring capabilities, and also provides unified service discovery and management for multiple infrastructures such as containers and virtual machines (VMs).

- Protocol extensions

    Extend the support of Dubbo protocol.

- Legacy SDK integration

    Provide integrated solutions for traditional microservice SDKs such as Spring Cloud and Dubbo. Businesses developed by traditional microservice SDKs can be quickly migrated to cloud-native mesh operating environments without extensive code modification.
