# Other Linux Offline Deployment of DCE 5.0 Enterprise

This page will introduce how to deploy DCE 5.0 on Other Linux operating system.

Other Linux is essentially because DCE does not provide the installation system offline package (OS package) for some Linux operating systems, and customers need to make it themselves.

## Authenticated OS

| Architecture | Release | System Family | Recommended Kernel |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ------------ | - ------------------ |
| AMD64 | UOS V20 (1050d) | Debian | 4.19.0-server-amd64 |
| AMD64 | AnolisOS 8.8 GA  | Redhat | 5.10.134-13.an8.x86_64 |

Remarks: If there is no verified operating system, you can try to deploy it through the tutorials in this document.

## Prerequisites

- Please read [Deployment Architecture](../commercial/deploy-arch.md) in advance to confirm this deployment mode.
- Please read [Deployment Requirements](../commercial/deploy-requirements.md) in advance to confirm whether the network, hardware, ports, etc. meet the requirements.
- Please read [Preparation](../commercial/prepare.md) in advance to confirm machine resources and pre-check.

## Make the operating system offline package (OS package)

### Production and installation

1. Download the authoring tool.

    ```bash
    cd /home
    curl -Lo ./pkgs.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubean-io/kubean/main/build/os-packages/others/pkgs.yml
    curl -Lo ./other_os_pkgs.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubean-io/kubean/main/build/os-packages/others/other_os_pkgs.sh && chmod +x other_os_pkgs.sh
    ```

2. Build the operating system offline package

     ```bash
     # Specify the path of the pkgs.yml package configuration file (if pkgs.yml is located in the same path as other_os_pkgs.sh, you can not set this environment variable)
     export PKGS_YML_PATH=/home/pkgs.yml
     # Run the system offline package build command
     ./other_os_pkgs.sh build
     ```

3. Install the OS offline package

     ```bash
     # Specify the path of the pkgs.yml package configuration file (if pkgs.yml is located in the same path as other_os_pkgs.sh, you can not set this environment variable)
     export PKGS_YML_PATH=/home/pkgs.yml
     # Specify the path of the os pkgs offline package
     export PKGS_TAR_PATH=/home/os-pkgs-${DISTRO}-${VERSION}.tar.gz
     # Specify the cluster master/worker node IP (multi-node IP addresses are separated by spaces)
     export HOST_IPS='192.168.10.11 192.168.10.12'
     # Specify the target node access information for installation (multi-node usernames and passwords must be consistent)
     export SSH_USER=root
     export SSH_PASS=dangerous
     # Run the installation command and output the log
     ./other_os_pkgs.sh install >>log.txt
     ```

4. After the installation is successful, the following log will be output:

    ```console
    [root@master test]# cat log.txt |egrep 'INFO|WARN'
    [WARN]   skip install yq ...
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'python-apt'
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'python3-apt'
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'aufs-tools'
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'apt-transport-https'
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'software-properties-common'
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'conntrack'
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'apparmor'
    [WARN]   the package 'libseccomp2' has been installed
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'ntp'
    [WARN]   the package 'openssl' has been installed
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'curl'
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'rsync'
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'socat'
    [WARN]   the package 'unzip' has been installed
    [WARN]   the package 'e2fsprogs' has been installed
    [WARN]   the package 'xfsprogs' has been installed
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'ebtables'
    [WARN]   the package 'bash-completion' has been installed
    [WARN]   the package 'tar' has been installed
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'ipvsadm'
    [INFO]   succeed to install package 'ipset'
    [INFO]   All packages for Node (192.168.10.11) have been installed.
    ```

### Notice

1. Check the installation status by `cat log.txt |egrep 'INFO|WARN'`:

    If the `failed to install package` keyword appears, it means that the installation is not successful, and when it finally fails, `the packages that failed to install are: ipset ipvsadm xfsprogs` will be output.

2. The package names corresponding to different versions (major version) of the same system family (os family) are different:

    | OS family | Version | Package |
    | -------------------- | ----- | ------------------ |
    | Debian | < 11 | python-apt |
    | | >= 11 | python3-apt |
    | Redhat Major Version | < 8 | libselinux-python |
    | | \>= 8 | python3-libselinux |

## Start offline installation

1. Download the full mode offline package, you can download the latest version in [Download Center](https://docs.daocloud.io/download/dce5/).

    | CPU Architecture | Version | Download URL |
    | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------- -------------- |
    | AMD64 | v0.6.1 | <https://qiniu-download-public.daocloud.io/DaoCloud_Enterprise/dce5/offline-v0.6.1-amd64.tar> |

    Unzip the offline package after downloading:

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://qiniu-download-public.daocloud.io/DaoCloud_Enterprise/dce5/offline-v0.6.1-amd64.tar
    tar -xvf offline-v0.6.1-amd64.tar
    ```

2. Download the image of the Other Linux operating system, here we take `UnionTech OS Server 20 1050d` as an example:

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://cdimage-download.chinauos.com/uniontechos-server-20-1050d-amd64.iso
    ```

3. Refer to the previous step `Making the offline package of the operating system`.

4. Download the addon offline package, you can download the latest version in [Download Center](../../download/index.md) (optional)

5. Set [clusterConfig.yaml](../commercial/cluster-config.md), which can be obtained under the offline package `offline/sample` and modified as needed.

    Parameter description:

    | Parameter                                               | Description                                | Required |
    | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
    | spec.kubeanConfig.allow_unsupported_distribution_setup | Whether to skip detection of supported OS   | Yes      |
    | spec.kubeanConfig.debian_os_family_extensions           | Can be filled by viewing `ansible_os_family` | Required if the system is Debian |
    | spec.kubeanConfig.redhat_os_family_extensions           | Can be filled by viewing `ansible_os_family` | Required if the system is Redhat |

    How to view the system family identifier for the current distribution environment:

    ```bash
    export USER=root
    export PASS=xxxx
    export ADDR=192.168.10.xxx
    export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
    ansible -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_os_family' -e "ansible_user=${USER} ansible_password=${PASS}" -i ${ADDR}, all
    ```

    After successful execution, the following information will be output:

    ```bash
    192.168.10.xxx | SUCCESS => {
        "ansible_facts": {
            "ansible_os_family": "UnionTech OS Server 20\" ",
            "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
        },
        "changed": false
    }
    ```

6. Start the installation of DCE 5.0.

    ```bash
    ./dce5-installer cluster-create -m ./sample/mainfest.yaml -c ./sample/clusterConfig.yaml
    ```

    !!! note

        Some parameters are introduced, and more parameters can be viewed through `./dce5-installer --help`:

        - `-z` minimal install
        - `-c` specifies the cluster configuration file, and does not need to specify `-c` when using NodePort to expose the console
        - `-d` enable debug mode
        - `--serial` specifies that all installation tasks are executed serially

7. After the installation is complete, the command line will prompt that the installation is successful. congratulations! :smile: Now you can use the default account and password (admin/changeme) to explore the new DCE 5.0 through the URL prompted on the screen!

    ![success](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/install/images/success.png)

    !!! success

        Please record the prompted URL for your next visit.

8. After successfully installing DCE 5.0 Enterprise, please contact us for authorization: email [info@daocloud.io](mailto:info@daocloud.io) or call 400 002 6898.
