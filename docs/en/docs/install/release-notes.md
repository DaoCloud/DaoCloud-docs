#### Bug fixes

- **FIXED** Bug fixes for offline package loading.

#### Known issues

- Because some operators need to be upgraded to support 1.25, DCE5 does not support 1.20 downwards.
- The default k8s version of kubean and the offline package are still limited to k8s 1.24 version, which has not been updated to 1.25 (postgres-operator is not supported yet).
- In the case of Image Load, the istio-ingressgateway imagePullPolicy is always.
- For the ARM version, step 16 (harbor) cannot be performed, because harbor does not support ARM for the time being. The mainfest.yaml file needs to be modified, the postgressql operator is fasle, and -j 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 should be added when executing the installation command
