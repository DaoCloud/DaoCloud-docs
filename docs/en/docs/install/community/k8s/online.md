# Online Install in a Standard Kubernetes Cluster

This page will guide you to install DCE Community package online in a standard Kubernetes cluster, which is recommended in the production environment.

!!! note

    - Click [Online Install DCE Community](../../../videos/install.md) to watch a video demo.
    - If you want install it offline, refer to [Offline Install](offline.md).

## Preparation

- Prepare a Kubernetes cluster. For resources required, see [Cluster Resources for Installing DCE Community](../resources.md).

    - Create a StorageClass and set it the default SC
    - Install CoreDNS in the cluster
    - If there is only one node in the cluster, make sure you have removed taints for that node

- [Install Dependencies](../../install-tools.md).

    You must install certain versions of each dependency:

    - helm ≥ 3.11.1
    - skopeo ≥ 1.11.1
    - kubectl ≥ 1.25.6
    - yq ≥ 4.31.1

## Download and Install

1. Download the `dce5-installer` binary file on the controller node of the Kubernetes cluster (you can also [download it via browser](../../../download/index.md).

    Take VERSION=v0.10.0 as an example.

    ```shell
    export VERSION=v0.10.0

    ## For ARM CPU, change `dce5-installer-$VERSION` to `dce5-installer-$VERSION-linux-arm64`.

    curl -Lo ./dce5-installer https://proxy-qiniu-download-public.daocloud.io/DaoCloud_Enterprise/dce5/dce5-installer-$VERSION
    chmod +x ./dce5-installer
    ```

2. Customize `clusterConfig.yaml`

    - If Console is exposed via NodePort (recommended only for PoC use cases), skip this step.

    - In non-public cloud environment (virtual/physical machine), please enable load balancer (metallb) to avoid NodePort instability caused by node IP changes. Plan your network carefully and set up 2 necessary VIPs. Here is an example of `clusterConfig.yaml`:

        ```yaml title="clusterConfig.yaml"
        apiVersion: provision.daocloud.io/v1alpha3
        kind: ClusterConfig
        spec:
          loadBalancer:
            type: metallb
            istioGatewayVip: 10.6.229.10/32 # (1)
            insightVip: 10.6.229.11/32 # (2)
        ```

        1. This is the VIP of the Istio gateway and also the browser URL of the DCE 5.0
        2. The VIP used by the Insight-Server of the global service cluster to collect the network paths of all sub-cluster monitoring metrics

     - If it is a public cloud environment that already has a Kubernetes load balancer, set `clusterConfig.yaml` as follows:

        ```yaml title="clusterConfig.yaml"
        apiVersion: provision.daocloud.io/v1alpha3
        kind: ClusterConfig
        spec:
          loadBalancer:
            type: cloudLB
        ```

3. Install DCE 5.0.

    ```shell
    ./dce5-installer install-app -c clusterConfig.yaml -z
    ```

    !!! note

        - Parameter `-p` specifies the offline directory to decompress the offline package.
        - For `clusterConfig.yaml` file settings, refer to [Online Installation](online.md#_2).
        - `-z` minimal install
        - `-c` specifies the cluster configuration file. You don't need to specify `-c` when using NodePort to expose the console.
        - `-d` enable debug mode
        - `--serial` specifies that all installation tasks are executed serially

4. After the installation is complete, the command line will prompt that the installation is successful. Congratulations!
    
    Now you can use the **default account and password (admin/changeme)** to explore the new DCE 5.0 through the URL prompted on the screen!

    !!! success

        Please write down the prompted URL for your next visit.

5. Before fully explore the features of DCE 5.0, you need to apply for a license. The Community package is provided for free. All you need to do is to [apply for a free license](../../../dce/license0.md).
