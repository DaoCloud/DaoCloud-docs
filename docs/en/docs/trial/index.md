    **Estimated Time:** 10-30 minutes

    **Background Description:** You need to have a certain understanding of Kubernetes and set up a standard Kubernetes cluster before starting the installation. The feature of this installation method is that it supports accessing DaoCloud Enterprise Community Edition through node ports and VIPs.
