# import repository

This page shows how to import repositories.

## Prerequisites

- Need to create a workspace and a user, the user needs to join the workspace and give `workspace edit` role.
  Refer to [Creating Workspaces](../../../ghippo/04UserGuide/02Workspace/Workspaces.md), [Users and Roles](../../../ghippo/04UserGuide/01UserandAccess/User. md).
- Prepare a Git repository.

## Import repository

If the codebase where the manifest file of the continuous deployment application is located is not public, you need to import the registry to the application workbench in advance. Application Workbench currently supports two import methods: `Import repository using HTTPS` and `Import repository using SSH`.

### Import repository using HTTPS

1. On `Application Workbench` -> `GitOps` -> `Repository` page, click the `Import Repository` button and select `Use HTTPS`.
