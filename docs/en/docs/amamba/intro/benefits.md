# Competitiveness

With years of leading experience in cloud native field, DaoCloud developed a brand-new Workbench that boasts strong competitiveness:

- Enterprise-level CI/CD

    With containerized workflows, Workbench provides continuous integration, continuous delivery, and horizontal scaling, to run thousands of concurrent users and pipelines in a high availability (HA) environment.

- Cloud native Infrastructure

    Workbench containerized the environment of building applications, customized resources such as building machines, ensuring pipeline-level resource isolation. It also supports deployment of multiple types of applications, simplifying the delivery of cloud native applications.

- Higher R&D Efficiency

    Declarative steps are encapsulated in a visualized pipeline building environment, so that you can easily create complicated pipelines without scripts with fool-proof UI guides. Environments can be automatically created or deleted according to resource sizes to avoid waste.

- Canary Release

    Workbench supports progressive delivery with canary release, blue/green release, and A/B test policies, ensuring a stable rollout of new features.

    For example, if an application's release policy is configured as AB Test, where version A should accept 80% traffic and version B 20% traffic. With canary release, both versions of the application are available for processing requests, allowing for easy statistics of the distribution ratio of different application versions.

- GitOps

    Workbench provides progressive delivery based on Kubernetes declarative GitOps. You can deploy automated application deployment and lifecycle management with version control tools.
  
- [Pipeline as code](../quickstart/deploy-pipeline.md)

    Workbench provides declarative pipelines. It is easy to create a pipeline with standardized UI forms. Its configuration also supports version control, modularization, reusability, and declarative syntax.

- Comprehensive Integration

    Workbench integrated popular DevOps tools in the community. Steps in a single pipeline can run on nodes that have multiple operating systems and architectures. It supports independent deployment on public clouds, private clouds, or hosts and can integrate well with self-owned systems and platforms. It also supports integration with mainstream software in the industry, such as Kubernetes, GitLab, SonarQube, and Harbor.

- Experience Accumulation

    After years of cultivation in the cloud native field, DaoCloud has extensive practical experience in industries such as finance, e-commerce, and manufacturing. It can provide stable and reliable IT delivery production lines to help enterprises build a platform suitable for integrated R&D and operation.
