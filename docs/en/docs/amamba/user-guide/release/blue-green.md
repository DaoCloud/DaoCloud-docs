# Create Blue-Green Release Job

Blue-green deployment gradually migrates user traffic from the old version to the new version
through traffic control. At the same time, the old version remains online and standby. If any
exception occurs during this period, the traffic can be immediately switched back to the old
version, achieving a quick rollback.

## Prerequisites

- Create a [workspace](../../../ghippo/user-guide/workspace/workspace.md) and a
  [user](../../../ghippo/user-guide/access-control/user.md). The user needs to
  join the workspace and have the __Workspace Editor__ role.

- The cluster where the release object is located has installed the Argo Rollout component.
  For specific installation methods, refer to [Manage Helm Apps](../../../kpanda/user-guide/helm/helm-app.md).

## Steps

1. Go to the __Workbench__ module, click __Progressive Delivery__ in the left navigation bar,
   and then click __Create Delivery Job__ -> __Blue/Green__ in the upper right corner of the page.
