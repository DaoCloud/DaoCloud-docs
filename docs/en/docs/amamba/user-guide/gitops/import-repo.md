# Import Repository

This page shows how to import repositories.

## Prerequisites

- A workspace and a user are required to be created. The user needs to join the workspace and be assigned the __workspace edit__ role.
  Refer to [Creating a Workspace](../../../ghippo/user-guide/workspace/workspace.md) and [Users](../../../ghippo/user-guide/access-control/user.md).
- A Git repository is prepared.

## Import a repository

If the code repository where the manifest files of the continuously deployed application are located is not public, you need to import the repository to Workbench in advance.
Workbench currently supports two import methods: __Importing a repository using HTTPS__ and __Importing a repository using SSH__.

### Import a repository using HTTPS

1. In the __Workbench__ -> __GitOps__ -> __Repositories__ page, click the __Import Repo__ button and select __Use HTTPS__.

### Import a repository using SSH
