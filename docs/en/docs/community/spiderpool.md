Spiderpool is a [Sandbox project](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=cloud-native-network&grouping=category) of [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io).

Spiderpool provides an underlay and RDMA network solution for Kubernetes, compatible with various runtime environments such as bare metal, virtual machines, and public clouds.

Spiderpool is a customized underlay and RDMA network solution for Kubernetes.
It enhances the functionality of
[Macvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/macvlan),
[ipvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/ipvlan),
and [SR-IOV CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-cni) to meet diverse network requirements.
It allows the underlay network solution to be applied in bare metal, virtual machine, and public cloud
environments, providing excellent network performance for network I/O intensive and low-latency
applications, including storage, middleware, AI, and more.
