# KWOK (`K`ubernetes `W`ith`O`ut `K`ubelet)

{ align=right }

[kwok](https://sigs.k8s.io/kwok) is a toolkit that enables setting up a cluster of thousands of Nodes in seconds.
Under the scene, all Nodes are simulated to behave like real ones, so the overall approach employs
a pretty low resource footprint that you can easily play around on your laptop.

So far we provide two tools:

- **Kwok:** Core of this repo. It simulates thousands of fake Nodes.
- **Kwokctl:** A CLI to facilitate creating and managing clusters simulated by Kwok.

Please see [https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io](https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io) for more in-depth information.
