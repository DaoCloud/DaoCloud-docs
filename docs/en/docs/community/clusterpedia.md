# Clusterpedia, The Encyclopedia of Kubernetes Clusters

This name Clusterpedia is inspired by Wikipedia. It is an encyclopedia of clusters to synchronize, search for, and easily control multicluster resources.

Clusterpedia can synchronize resources with multiple clusters.
It also provides more powerful search features on the basis of compatibility with Kubernetes OpenAPI.
It helps you effectively get any multicluster resource that you are looking for in a quick and easy way.

!!! info

    Clusterpedia can search for, view, and control resources in the future, just like Wikipedia that supports entry editing.

!!! info "About CNCF"

    CNCF is the open source, vendor-neutral hub of cloud native computing, hosting projects like Kubernetes and Prometheus to make cloud native universal and sustainable.

    The CNCF Cloud Native Landscape Project is intended as a map through the previously uncharted terrain of cloud native technologies.
    This attempts to categorize most of the projects and product offerings in the cloud native space.
    There are many routes to deploying a cloud native application, with CNCF Projects representing a particularly well-traveled path.
