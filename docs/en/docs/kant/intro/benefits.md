# Product Advantages

Cloud Edge Collaboration offers six core capabilities that address various business needs, enabling efficient collaboration of cloud-edge computing resources and data.

## Edge Autonomy

- **Offline Processing Capabilities:** The edge side functions as a complete system, independent of the cloud, capable of handling offline processing tasks.
- **Self-Management in Weak/No-Network Environments:** Edge nodes possess self-management capabilities to ensure the continuity of application operations even in weak or no-network conditions.

## Intelligent Operation and Maintenance

- **Full Lifecycle Monitoring of Edge Nodes:** Continuous monitoring of edge nodes throughout their lifecycle.
- **Full Lifecycle Monitoring of Edge Applications:** Comprehensive monitoring of edge applications from deployment to decommissioning.

## Pluggable Device Access

- **Multi-Protocol Terminal Access:** Supports multiple protocol terminal access, including Modbus, and provides a standard Device Management Interface (DMI) for device connectivity.
- **Bulk Device Import:** Facilitates the bulk import of devices using specified format files.

## Comprehensive Security Assurance

- **Multi-Level Permission Management:** Ensures resource isolation and security with multi-level permission management for platforms, folders, and workspaces.
- **Bidirectional Data Encryption Transmission:** Supports secure data transmission between cloud and edge using TLS encryption.
- **Audit Log Function:** Provides an audit log function to track and monitor activities.

## Data Collaboration

- **Cloud-Edge Message Routing:** Supports bidirectional transmission of time-series messages between cloud and edge.
- **Cloud-Edge Data Channels:** Facilitates the bidirectional transmission of unstructured data, such as images and videos, between cloud and edge.

## Edge Intelligence

- **Containerized Model Deployment:** Supports running models in container mode on edge nodes.
- **Batch Deployment and Upgrading of Models:** Enables efficient batch deployment and upgrading of models, ensuring up-to-date intelligence at the edge.
