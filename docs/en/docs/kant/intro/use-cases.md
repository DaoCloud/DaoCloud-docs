# Use Cases

Cloud Edge Collaboration is ideal for the following scenarios:

## Smart Factory

Cloud Edge Collaboration helps users quickly build a platform near the data source of factory IoT devices, enabling real-time data collection and analysis. This allows for the establishment of factory analytics models, which can perceive and mitigate environmental and production risks, enhance production efficiency, and reduce production costs.

- **Protocol Adaptation:** Supports multiple industrial protocols for unified access and management of production equipment, enabling quick data collection and local preprocessing and analysis.
- **Real-Time Risk Perception:** Monitors environmental risks and production processes in real-time, facilitating rapid decision-making.
- **Unified Deployment and Monitoring:** Allows for the unified deployment of applications and models, as well as consistent monitoring of node status.

## Smart Store

Leveraging edge computing, artificial intelligence, and cloud-native technologies, Cloud Edge Collaboration transforms the management of people, goods, and consumption scenarios. This approach uncovers new opportunities, boosts efficiency, and enhances user experience.

- **Local Computing and Business Capabilities:** Ensures fast response times and low coupling by sinking computing and business capabilities to the edge.
- **High Stability in Complex Networks:** Enables independent control of store marketing videos, ensuring high stability even in complex network environments.
- **Unified Management and Analysis:** Provides cloud-based unified management and analysis of edge nodes and applications, facilitating quick fault location and improving operational efficiency.
