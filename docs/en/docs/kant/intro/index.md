# What is Cloud Edge Collaboration

In the past two years, there have been expectedly over tens of billions of terminals and sensors globally,
of which China accounts for approximately 7% of the global number. The scale of these nodes far exceeds
that of the Internet, and the number of IoT access nodes is trending towards explosive growth.

The development of IoT has brought new challenges to real-time network transmission and network bandwidth,
and has also put forward new requirements for data storage, analysis, and processing.
The centralized cloud computing model can no longer meet the efficient transmission and processing requirements
of massive data under the interconnection of all things. With the development of 5G, edge computing has emerged.

Cloud edge collaboration extends cloud native capabilities to the edge, using an edge node model to sink data processing,
business applications, and AI models down to the edge for execution. This solves problems such as response real-time,
privacy, maintenance convenience, and other issues when deploying IoT on the ground, thereby meeting critical needs in
industries' digitization, such as agile connections, real-time business, data optimization, smart applications,
security, and privacy protection.
