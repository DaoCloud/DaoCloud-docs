# Download Resumption Guide

This guide provides instructions for implementing download resumption for large files using HTTP range requests.

## Server-Side Implementation

1. **Enable HTTP Range Requests**:
   - Configure the server to support HTTP range requests, allowing clients to request specific byte ranges of a file.
   - Ensure the server can serve partial content with HTTP status code 206.

## Client-Side Implementation

1. **Detect Interruptions**:
   - Implement logic to detect download interruptions and automatically retry using range requests.
   - Store the current download progress and resume from the last successful byte received.

## Testing

Conduct thorough testing to ensure seamless download resumption across different network conditions and file sizes.
