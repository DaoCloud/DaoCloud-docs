     On the one hand, the limitations of eBPF mean that L7 traffic proxies still need userspace network proxies to do their job;
     On the other hand, host-based proxies are inferior in operation, maintenance, and security compared to sidecars.
     In the future, Linkerd will continue to use eBPF technology to make sidecar agents smaller and lighter.

### Security Vulnerabilities

- [Istio High Risk Vulnerability: A user with localhost access can impersonate the identity of any workload](https://github.com/istio/istio/security/advisories/GHSA-6c6p-h79f-g6p4)

     If a user has localhost access to the Istiod control plane, they can impersonate any workload identity within the service mesh.
     The affected version is 1.15.2. Currently, the patch version [1.15.3](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.15.3) has been released.

- [Istio high-risk vulnerability: Golang Regex library leads to DoS attack](https://github.com/istio/istio/security/advisories/GHSA-86vr-4wcv-mm9w)

     Istiod has a request processing error vulnerability that allows an attacker to crash the control plane by sending custom or oversized messages when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed.
     Currently, [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases) has released patch versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9. Versions earlier than 1.14.4, 1.13.8, or 1.12.9 are affected by this.

- [CrowdStrike discovers new cryptojacking attack targeting Docker and Kubernetes infrastructure](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/new-kiss-a-dog-cryptojacking-campaign-targets-docker-and-kubernetes/)

     The attack uses container evasion techniques and anonymous mining pools to deliver its workload using an obfuscated domain name to conduct cryptocurrency mining activities against Docker and Kubernetes infrastructure.
     Adopting a cloud security protection platform can effectively protect the cloud environment from similar mining activities, prevent misconfiguration and control plane attacks.

- [Kube-apiserver CVE Vulnerability: Aggregated API server may cause Server Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#cve-2022- 3172-aggregated-api-server-can-cause-clients-to-be-redirected-ssrf)

     An attacker could take control of the aggregated API server, redirecting client traffic to any URL. This could cause the client to perform unexpected actions, or expose the client certificate to a third party.
     There is no mitigation for this issue. Cluster administrators should take care to secure the aggregated API Server and not allow access to mutate API Services by untrusted parties.
     Affected versions: kube-apiserver 1.25.0, 1.24.0 - 1.24.4, 1.23.0 - 1.23.10, 1.22.0 - 1.22.14. Fixed versions: 1.25.1, 1.24.5, 1.23.11, 1.22.14.

- [Aqua discovered a new type of illegal encrypted mining method that can use containers to consume network bandwidth](https://blog.aquasec.com/cryptojacking-cloud-network-bandwidth)

     Recently, Aqua Security issued an alert about a new type of mining attack. Compared with traditional mining attacks, which will cause a sharp increase in CPU consumption, new attacks use containers to consume network bandwidth, but the increase in CPU consumption is not significant.
     Therefore, security tools that rely on CPU utilization to identify attacks may miss the threat.
     Running security tools that can analyze containers both statically and dynamically is the most effective way to defend against attacks, Aqua suggests.

- [Istio Vulnerability: Sending Malformed Header to Envoy Could Cause Unknown Memory Access](https://istio.io/latest/news/security/istio-security-2022-006/)

     In the affected versions (1.14.2 and 1.13.6), malformed headers sent to Envoy in certain configurations could cause unknown behavior or crashes. The vulnerability was resolved in versions 1.12.8, 1.13.5, and 1.14.1. Additionally, Istio officially recommends against installing 1.14.2 or 1.13.6 in production environments.

- [CRI-O vulnerability: Kube API access may cause memory exhaustion on the node](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2022-1708)

     CRI-O reads the output of ExecSync requests. If the amount of output data is large, it may exhaust the memory or disk space of the node, posing a threat to system availability. Currently, the article does not give a solution.

- [Istio control plane has a request processing vulnerability](https://istio.io/latest/news/security/istio-security-2022-004/)

     Istiod has a request processing vulnerability that could allow an attacker sending a custom or very large message to crash the control plane process.
     The risk of attack is greatest when the Kubernetes authentication or change webhook service is publicly exposed. This vulnerability is a 0day vulnerability.
