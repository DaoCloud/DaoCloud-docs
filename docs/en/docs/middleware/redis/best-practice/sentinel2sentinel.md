# Sentinel mode to Sentinel mode

Redis-shake supports data synchronization and migration capabilities between Sentinel mode instances. In this example, we will demonstrate the configuration method for cross-cluster synchronization using a 3-replica Sentinel mode Redis.

Let's assume that **instance redis-a** and **instance redis-b** are in different clusters. Both instances are running in a 3-replica Sentinel mode. We will set up a synchronization structure where **instance redis-a** acts as the master instance and **instance redis-b** acts as the slave instance, providing the following disaster recovery support:

- Under normal circumstances, **instance redis-a** serves external requests and continuously synchronizes data to **instance redis-b**.
- If the master **instance redis-a** goes offline due to a failure, **instance redis-b** takes over and serves external requests.
- Once the master **instance redis-a** recovers, the incremental data is written back from **instance redis-b** to **instance redis-a**.
- After the data recovery of **instance redis-a** is complete, it switches back to the initial state where **instance redis-a** serves external requests and continues data synchronization with **instance redis-b**.

!!! note

    Data synchronization and data recovery need to be performed by different Redis-shake instances. Therefore, in this example, we need to create two Redis-shake instances: __Redis-shake-sync__ and __Redis-shake-recovery__ .

## Data Synchronization Deployment

### Configuring Service for the Source Instance

If the source instance is in a DCE 5.0 cluster, you can enable the solution in __Data Services__ -> __Redis__ -> __Cross-Cluster Master-Slave Synchronization__ , and the service configuration will be automatically completed.


If the source instance is in a third-party cluster, you need to manually configure the service. The configuration method is described below:

Create a __NodePort__ service for the Redis instance to allow data synchronization access from Redis-Shake. In this example, we need to create one service for **instance redis-a**. Here's the process:

1. Go to __Container Management__ -> __Cluster where the source instance is located__ -> __StatefulSets__ : Select the workload __redis-a__ and create a __NodePort__ service with the container port and service port set to 6379.


2. Verify the service and make sure that the workload selector includes the following labels.

    ```yaml
    app.kubernetes.io/component: redis
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: redis-operator
    app.kubernetes.io/name: redis-a
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: redis-failover
    redis-failover: master
    redisfailovers.databases.spotahome.com/name: redis-a
    ```

#### Creating Configuration

In __Container Management__ -> __Cluster where the target instance is located__ -> __Configuration and Storage__ -> __Configurations__ , create a configmap __redis-sync__ for the Redis-shake instance. Import the file __sync.toml__ (file content can be found in the __Appendix__ ), and make sure to modify the following:


- source.address: The service address of the source instance __redis-a__ created in the previous step:

    ```toml
    address = "10.233.109.145:31278"
    ```

- Access password for the source instance: This can be obtained from the Overview page of the Redis instance:

    ```toml
    password = "3wPxzWffdn" # keep empty if no authentication is required
    ```


- Address for accessing the target instance. This address can either be the newly created __ClusterIP__ service address or the default __Headless__ service address __rfr-redis-b__ of the instance __redis-b__ . In this example, we use the __Headless__ service address:

    ```toml
    address = "rfr-redis-b:6379"
    ```

    You can find this service information in __Cluster Management__ -> __Cluster where the target instance is located__ -> __Workloads__ -> __Access Method__ . Similar to the following screenshot:


- Access password for the target instance. This can be obtained from the Redis instance's Overview page under the Data Services module:

    ```toml
    password = "3wPxzWffdn" # keep empty if no authentication is required
    ```

    Similar to the following location:


- Set the target type to __standalone__ :

    ```toml
    [target]
    type = "standalone" # "standalone" or "cluster"
    ```

#### Creating Redis-shake

1. Open the __App Workbench__ , select __Wizard__ -> __Based on Container Image__ and create an application __Redis-shake-sync__ :


2. Fill in the application configuration as per the instructions below.

    - The cluster and namespace of the application should match the Redis instance.
    - Image address:

        ```yaml
        release.daocloud.io/ndx-product/redis-shake@sha256:46652d7d8893fa4508c3c6725afc1e211fb9cb894c4dc85e94287395a32fc3dc
        ```

    - The access type for the default service is set to NodePort, with container port and service port both set to 6379.


    - __Advanced Settings__ -> __Lifecycle__ -> __Startup Command__ - Enter the run parameter:

        ```yaml
        /etc/sync/sync.toml
        ```

    - __Advanced Settings__ -> __Data Storage__ : Add configmap __redis-sync__ and set the path to:

        ```yaml
        /etc/sync
        ```

    - __Advanced Settings__ -> __Data Storage__ : Add a temporary path with the container path set to:

        ```yaml
        /data
        ```

3. Click __OK__ to complete the creation of Redis-shake.

Once Redis-shake is created, data synchronization between Redis instances will begin. You can verify the synchronization using the __redis-cli__ tool, but we won't go into detail here.

## Data Recovery

Diagram: Data Recovery **instance redis-b** >> **instance redis-a**

When the source instance **instance redis-a** comes back online, we need to recover the incremental data from the target instance **instance redis-b**. This requires deploying another Redis-shake instance on **instance redis-a** to achieve data recovery from **instance redis-b** to **instance redis-a**. The configuration process is similar to the data synchronization process, but in the opposite direction. Once the Redis-shake is created, data recovery will automatically begin.

!!! note

    Before bringing the source instance online, make sure to stop the __Redis-shake-sync__ used for normal synchronization to avoid incorrect synchronization overwriting newly added data.

## Restoring the Master-Slave Relationship

To restore the initial master-slave synchronization relationship **instance redis-a** >> **instance redis-b**, stop the running __Redis-shake-recovery__ instance in the cluster where **instance redis-a** is located in the __Container Management__ . Then, restart the __Redis-shake-sync__ instance in the target cluster, and the initial master-slave relationship will be reestablished.
