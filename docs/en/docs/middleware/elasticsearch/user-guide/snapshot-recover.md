# Elasticsearch Backup and Recovery

Elasticsearch's backup and recovery feature helps you backup data from an entire cluster or a single index, 
in case you need to recover them. You can set up an automatic snapshot policy to regularly backup data or 
manually backup selected indices.

The first backup snapshot of an instance is a complete copy of the data in that instance, while all subsequent 
backup snapshots retain the incremental data. Therefore, the initial backup takes a longer time (the specific 
duration depends on the amount of data), while subsequent snapshot backups will be faster.

## Backup Setting and Methods

### Configure Backup Path

1. On the left navigation bar, click __Backup Management__ -> __Backup Setting__ .

2. Select `S3 Backup` from the added workspace and fill in the backup path.

    !!! info

        Both manual and automatic backups rely on the backup settings here.
