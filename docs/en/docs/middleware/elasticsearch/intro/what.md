# What is Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch, the current full-text search engine of the best choice, can quickly store, search, and analyze a sea of data. Elasticsearch is built on top of Lucene that cannot be used directly. It encapsulates Lucene and provides out-of-box REST APIs.

Based on Elasticsearch, the search service built into DCE 5.0 offers a distributed search service,  provides users with structured and unstructured text as well as AI vector-based multi-criteria search, statistics, and reports. It is fully compatible with Elasticsearch native interface. It can help websites and APPs build search boxes to improve users' search experience; it can also be used to build log analysis platforms to realize data-driven operation and maintenance; its vector search can help users quickly build rich applications such as AI-based image search, recommendation, semantic search and face recognition.



## Task management for ElasticSearch

Raw data flows into Elasticsearch from a variety of sources, including logs, system metrics, and web applications. Data ingestion is the process by which this raw data is parsed, normalized, and enriched before it is indexed in Elasticsearch. Once indexed in Elasticsearch, users can run complex queries against their data and use aggregations to retrieve complex summaries of their data. From Kibana, users can create powerful visualizations of their data.

## What is Kibana

Kibana is a data visualization and management tool for Elasticsearch that provides real-time histograms, line graphs, pie charts, and maps. Kibana also includes advanced applications such as Canvas, which allows users to create custom dynamic infographics based on their data, and Elastic Maps for visualizing geospatial data.
