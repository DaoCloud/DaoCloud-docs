# Add custom plugins for RabbitMQ

## Problem Description

RabbitMQ has many plug-ins, but when installing RabbitMQ, only the default plug-ins can be installed. If you need to install other plug-ins, you need to install them manually after the installation is complete.

## solution

In the yaml of RabbitMQ created, add initContainer to download the plugin, then hang the plugin in the plugin directory of RabbitMQ, and finally add the configuration of the plugin in the config of rabbitmq, and enable the plugin in the enabled plugin module .

## Example

Here, taking rabbitmq_message_timestamp-3.8.0.ez as an example, the main content is as follows:

- Added initContainer for downloading plugins
- Then hang the plugin in the plugin directory of RabbitMQ
- In the config of rabbitmq, the configuration of the plug-in is added
- and enable the plugin in the enabled plugins module

The plug-in here uses the official github as the download address, and it is generated and used. It is recommended to maintain the plug-in location by yourself to avoid download failure.

## Precautions

Currently, it is supported to manually edit custom resources in YAML to add corresponding plug-ins. There are certain operational risks, and it is recommended to operate with caution.
