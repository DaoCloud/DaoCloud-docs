3. Click __Logs__ to enter the log view page.

## Log View Instructions

On the log viewing page, we can easily view logs. Common operations are described as follows:

* Support custom log time range. In the upper right corner of the log page, you can easily switch the time range 
  to view the log (the viewable log range is subject to the log duration saved in the observable system settings).
* Support searching logs through keywords. The search area on the left supports viewing more log information.
* Support viewing log volume distribution. With the histogram in the upper middle area, you can view the 
  log volume distribution within the time range.
* Support viewing the context of the log, click the __context__ icon on the right.
* Support exporting logs.
