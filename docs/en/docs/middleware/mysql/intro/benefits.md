MySQL has the following product advantages.

- lead the industry
  
    - Supports rapid deployment and life cycle management of ActiveMQ. ActiveMQ is currently the most popular open source multi-protocol database. It supports applications and platforms written in JavaScript, C, C++, Python, .Net and other languages, and can exchange messages across applications. The management operations of production clusters, consumption clusters, message queries, etc. are realized through the message console.

    - Adopt the industry's advanced and mature technology route to ensure the stability and reliability of the platform; at the same time, fully consider the convenience of user interaction and the ease of use of the interface operation, adopt the popular flexible and easy-to-expand system architecture, and use the advanced technology framework route to carry out Design and development, support the collaborative work of various components based on API calls, and can meet the information interaction of vertical integration and horizontal integration of the system.

    - A reliable technical architecture is adopted to support the stable operation of the system, and each component can provide high availability, which can ensure the redundancy and high availability of key components.

    - It can collect, analyze and process the internal state data of its own operation, and summarize it into index data through reasonable aggregation, so that the operation and maintenance personnel can understand the real-time state of the system operation in the shortest time, and at the same time provide the corresponding API for Other systems read status indicator data.

- Life cycle management

    - Supports creating, updating and deleting MySQL instances graphically or via YAML.

    - Supports hot deployment and hot update. Except for major upgrades such as general technical service component upgrades and platform upgrades, system deployment and upgrades do not require downtime.

- GUI operation

    Support graphical creation, viewing, updating, deletion and elastic expansion. Administrators can customize graphical parameters according to their preferences.

- Containerized messaging platform

    Based on Kubernetes and Docker, MySQL natively supports containerized deployment to maximize resource utilization.

- Compatibility and openness

    - MySQL is compatible with Intel CPUs and domestic CPUs (such as Feiteng ARM, Huawei Kunpeng ARM and Haiguang x86, etc.), compatible with domestic operating systems (such as Kirin operating system v10, Tongxin server operating system UOS, etc.), all of which have authorized electronic certificates and certificates.

    - It has an open architecture and provides an open standard API interface to ensure that resources and services such as basic capabilities, management services, logs, and monitoring are efficiently scheduled, managed, and used, and supports third-party management platforms to achieve related orchestration and use through API interfaces, etc. .
