# Create a MinIO instance

1. Select __MinIO Object Storage__ from the navigation bar on the left.

    ![MinIO object storage](../images/minio-create01.png)

2. You can click the __New Instance__ button in the upper right corner of the list.

    > If you are using it for the first time, you need to [select a workspace](../../common/index.md) and click __Deploy Now__ to create a MinIO instance.

3. Fill in the basic information of the instance by referring to the information below, and then click __Next__ .

    !!! note

        - The instance name and cluster/namespace cannot be modified after the instance is created.
        - Pay attention to check the filling requirements below the input box, and enter the content that meets the requirements.
        - If the installation environment test fails, you can follow the prompts to install the relevant plug-ins and re-create the instance, or you can check __Continue without Insight component__ and proceed directly to follow-up operations.

4. Fill in the configuration specifications with reference to the information below, and then click __Next__ .

    - Deploy Mode cannot be changed after the instance is created.
    - High Availability is recommended in production mode.
    - At least 4 Replicas are required in high availability mode.
    - Storage Class indicates that the selected storage class should have enough available resources, otherwise the instance creation will fail due to insufficient resources.
    - Storage capacity shows how much capacity each disk has. It **cannot be lowered after instance creation**.
    - Disks per Replica shows how many secondary disks to provide for each copy. It **cannot be lowered after instance creation**.

    !!! warning

        After a MinIO instance is successfully created, scaling replicas and modifying disk usage are not supported. Please configure resources carefully.

5. Fill in the service settings with reference to the information below, and click __Next__ .

    - ClusterIP: services can only be accessed within the same cluster.
    - NodePort: services can be accessed through node IP and static ports, and support access to services from outside the cluster.
    - LoadBalancer indicates using the cloud service provider's load balancer to make the service publicly accessible
    - Load Balancer/External Traffic Policy: Specifies whether the service routes external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide breakpoints

        - Cluster: Traffic can be forwarded to Pods on other nodes in the cluster
        - Local: Traffic can only be forwarded to Pods on this node

    - Console account: the username and password needed to access this newly created instance

    ??? note "Click to view advanced configuration instructions"

        - Bucket Name: create a new bucket under this instance, and set the name of the new bucket.
        - Scheduling policy/condition: set the node affinity of Pod scheduling, refer to the official Kubernetes document [node affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod -node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

            - Preferred: try to schedule to the nodes that meet the rules first. Pod scheduling is also performed if no matching node is found
            - Required: Pod scheduling is only performed when a node satisfying the rules is found

        - Scheduling strategy/weight: Set weights for nodes that meet each scheduling strategy, preferably using a strategy with a high weight. Value range 1 to 100
        - Scheduling strategy/selector

            - In: The node must contain the selected label, and the value of the label must **belong** to a set of values. Multiple values ​​are separated by __;__ 
            - NotIn: The node must contain the selected label, and the value of the label must **not belong to a value set. Multiple values ​​are separated by __;__ 
            - Exists: It is enough for the node to contain a certain label, and do not pay attention to the specific value of the label
            - DoesNotExists: The node does not contain a certain label, and does not pay attention to the specific value of the label
            - Gt: The node must contain a certain label, and the value of the label must be greater than a certain integer
            - Lt: The node must contain a certain label, and the value of the label must be less than a certain integer

6. Confirm that the instance configuration information is correct, and click __OK__ to complete the creation.

    ![Confirm](../images/minio-create07.png)

7. Return to the instance list page to check whether the instance is successfully created.

    > The status of the newly created instance is __Not Ready__ , and the status becomes __Running__ after all related containers are successfully started.
