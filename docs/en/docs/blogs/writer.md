# Personal Profile

- **Name:** HAIFENG YAO
- **Occupation:** Senior Technical Writer  
- **Company:** DaoCloud  
- **Experience:** Over 3 years in technical writing and documentation  

I am HAIFENG YAO, a dedicated and skilled senior technical writer with over three years of experience
at DaoCloud, a leading company in the cloud native technology space. My primary responsibility involves
creating, maintaining, and enhancing comprehensive technical documentation for various products. These
documents serve as essential resources for users, guiding them on how to install, utilize, and
troubleshoot our products effectively.

My work primarily encompasses two key documentation platforms:

- [docs.daocloud.io](http://docs.daocloud.io)
- [docs.d.run](http://docs.d.run)

I am applying for a visa to attend KubeCon, which will take place in Salt Lake City from
November 12-15, 2024. I received an invitation to this prestigious conference in recognition
of my significant contributions to cloud native documentation within the open-source community,
which is spearheaded by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a prominent branch of
the Linux Foundation.

I am an active document contributor to various projects within the CNCF ecosystem and currently
serve as a maintainer or approver for:

- Kubernetes
- Istio
- OpenTelemetry
- Karmada
- Spiderpool
- HwameiStor
- Kubean
- CloudTTY
- Merbridge

In the past year, I have made substantial contributions to Kubernetes and Istio, as indicated by my activity on DevStats:

- **Kubernetes**: 2,262 contributions
- **Istio**: 1,063 contributions

I had the privilege of speaking at KubeCon Shanghai 2023 and KCD Shanghai 2024. Additionally, I served as a member of the KubeCon Program Committee for the following events:

- KubeCon Paris 2024
- KubeCon Hong Kong 2024
- KubeCon Salt Lake City 2024
- KubeCon New Delhi 2024

My involvement in the open-source community extends beyond documentation. I had the privilege of
being a speaker at KubeCon Shanghai 2023 and KCD Shanghai 2024, where I shared insights on how
beginners can effectively contribute documentation to the open-source ecosystem. These experiences
have not only enriched my professional journey but have also allowed me to engage with a vibrant
community of like-minded individuals passionate about technology and collaboration.

Attending KubeCon Salt Lake City 2024 represents a crucial opportunity for me to further my
professional development, network with industry leaders, and share best practices with
fellow contributors. I am eager to learn from the sessions and discussions, which will
ultimately enhance my contributions to the cloud native community.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to
participate in this important event.
