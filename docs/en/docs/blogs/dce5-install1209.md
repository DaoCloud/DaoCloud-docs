# Nanny install DCE 5.0 Community Edition

Author: [SAMZONG](https://github.com/SAMZONG)

This article completes the installation of DCE 5.0 Community Edition from 0 to 1, including K8s cluster, dependencies, network, storage and other details and more considerations.

## Cluster planning

It is planned to use 3 UCloud VMs, all configured with 8-core 16G.

| Role | Hostname | Operating System | IP | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| master | master-k8s-com | CentOS 7.9 | 10.23.245.63 | 8 cores 16G 300GB |
| node01 | node01-k8s-com | CentOS 7.9 | 10.23.104.173 | 8 cores 16G 300GB |
| node02 | node02-k8s-com | CentOS 7.9 | 10.23.112.244 | 8 cores 16G 300GB |

The planned cluster components are:

- Kubernetes 1.24.8
-CRI containerd
-CNI Calico
-StorageClass HwameiStior

## Node system optimization

Do some optimizations on 3 nodes before installation.

1. Configure the hostname

     ```bash
     hostnamctl set-hostname master-k8s-com
     ```

1. Add /etc/hosts configuration

     ```bash
     cat <<EOF | tee /etc/hosts
     10.23.245.63 master-k8s-com
     10.23.104.173 node01-k8s-com
     10.23.112.244 node02-k8s-com
     EOF
     ```

1. Disable Swap

     ```bash
     swapoff -a
     sed -i '/swap/s/^/#/' /etc/fstab
     ```

1. Disable SElinux

     ```bash
     setenforce 0
     sed -i 's/^SELINUX=enforcing$/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config
     ```

1. Turn off the firewall

     ```bash
     systemctl stop firewalld
     systemctl disable firewalld
     ```

1. Allow iptables to inspect bridged traffic

     Load the `br_netfilter` module:

     ```bash linenums="1"
     cat <<EOF | tee /etc/modules-load.d/kubernetes.conf
     br_netfilter
     EOF

     # load the module
     modprobe br_netfilter
     ```

     Modify the `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables` setting to 1:

     ```bash linenums="1"
     cat <<EOF | tee /etc/sysctl.d/kubernetes.conf
     net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=1
     net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1
     EOF

     # Refresh configuration
     sysctl --system
     ```

## Install K8s

Start installing the container runtime and K8s system components, initialize the Master node, join the Worker node, and install the network CNI.

### Install the container runtime

In this example, Docker and containerd are installed at the same time for the convenience of pulling the image later. DCE 5.0 actually uses containerd.

1. Install Docker's software source

     ```bash
     sudo yum install -y yum-utils
     sudo yum-config-manager \
         --add-repo \
         https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
     ```

1. Install Docker and containerd

     ```bash
     sudo yum -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
     ```

1. Modify the configuration of Docker

     ```bash linenums="1"
     sudo touch /etc/docker/daemon.json

     cat <<EOF | tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
     {
       "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
     }
     EOF
     ```

1. Modify the configuration of containerd

     ```bash linenums="1"
     # Clean up configuration files
     sudo rm -f /etc/containerd/config.toml

     # Initialize configuration
     sudo containerd config default | sudo tee /etc/containerd/config.toml

     # Update configuration file content
     sed -i 's/SystemdCgroup\ =\ false /SystemdCgroup\ =\ true/' /etc/containerd/config.toml
     sed 's/k8s.gcr.io\/pause/registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com\/google_containers\/pause/g' /etc/containerd/config.toml
     ```

1. Start service configuration

     ```bash linenums="1"
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     sudo systemctl enable --now docker
     sudo systemctl enable --now containerd
     ```

1. Check that the configuration is successful

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status docker containerd
    sudo docker info
    ```

### Install K8s system components

1. Install the Kubernetes repository

     The source of domestic Alibaba Cloud is used here, which has an acceleration effect.

    ```bash linenums="1"
    cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
    [kubernetes]
    name=Kubernetes
    baseurl=https://mirrors.aliyun.com/kubernetes/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-x86_64/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    repo_gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=https://mirrors.aliyun.com/kubernetes/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg https://mirrors.aliyun.com/kubernetes/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg
    EOF
    ```

1. Install Kubernetes components

    ```bash linenums="1"
    echo K8sVersion=1.24.8
    sudo yum install -y kubelet-1.24.8-$K8sVersion kubeadm-1.24.8-$K8sVersion
    sudo yum install -y kubectl-1.24.8-$K8sVersion  # 可以仅在 Master 节点安装
    ```

1. Start the `kubelet` system service

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable --now kubelet
    ```

At this time, after starting, the service status is found to be abnormal, and the cluster configuration will be checked. Because there is no configuration, it will continue to restart without affecting subsequent operations.

### Initialize the Master node

Pay attention to planning the configuration of the master node of the cluster, and plan the network configuration when initializing the master node.

Specify the corresponding K8s version, and pay attention to keep it consistent with the configuration during installation:

```bash
sudo kubeadm init --kubernetes-version=v1.24.8 \
 --image-repository=registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/google_containers \
 --pod-network-cidr 10.11.0.0/16 \
```

The output is similar to:

    Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

    To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

      mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
      sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
      sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

    Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

      export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

    You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
    Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
      https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

    Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

    kubeadm join 10.23.245.63:6443 --token djdsj2.sj23js90213j323 \
            --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:ewuosdjk2390rjertw32p32j43p25a70298db818ajsdjk1293jk23k23201934h
    ```

### Join the Worker node

Make sure that the above steps are completed: node system optimization, container runtime installation, K8s system components installation, and master node initialization successfully.

Run the following command to join the Worker node:

```bash
kubeadm join 10.23.245.63:6443 --token djdsj2.sj23js90213j323 \
  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:ewuosdjk2390rjertw32p32j43p25a70298db818ajsdjk1293jk23k23201934h
```

View the newly added Worker node:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

The output is similar to:

```none
NAME               STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
master01-k8s-com   Ready    control-plane   9h    v1.24.8
node01-k8s-com     Ready    <none>          9h    v1.24.8
node02-k8s-com     Ready    <none>          9h    v1.24.8
```

Run the command to initialize `Calico`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f calico.yaml
```

## Install Helm

This example uses Helm 3, note that the installation script will download the latest version:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

## Install StorageClass

K8s localdisk is used as the default storage when installed by default. This example uses an open source project
[HwameiStor](https://hwameistor.io/cn/docs/quick_start/install/deploy) is used for local disk management.

1. Download and unzip HwameiStor Repo

    ```bash linenums="1"
    helm repo add hwameistor http://hwameistor.io/hwameistor
    helm repo update hwameistor
    helm pull hwameistor/hwameistor --untar
    ```

1. Install HwameiStor

    Install using a container registry. To switch the image of the container registry, use --set to change the values of these two parameters:
    `global.k8sImageRegistry` and `global.hwameistorImageRegistry`

    > Note the default registries quay.io and ghcr.io. If you can't access it, you can try to use the image sources quay.m.daocloud.io and ghcr.m.daocloud.io provided by DaoCloud

    ```bash linenums="1"
    helm install hwameistor ./hwameistor \
      -n hwameistor --create-namespace \
      --set global.k8sImageRegistry=k8s-gcr.m.daocloud.io \
      --set global.hwameistorImageRegistry=ghcr.m.daocloud.io
    ```

1. Check the status of all Pods of HwameiStor

    ```bash
    kubectl -n hwameistor get pod
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```none
    NAME                                                       READY   STATUS

    hwameistor-local-storage-zkwmn                             2/2     Running
    hwameistor-scheduler-58dfcf79f5-lswkt                      1/1     Running
    hwameistor-webhook-986479678-278cr                         1/1     Running
    ```

    Both local-disk-manager and local-storage are DaemonSets. There should be a DaemonSet Pod on each K8s node.

    After all the statuses are normal, follow-up operations can be performed to check `StorageClass`:

    ```bash
    kubectl get storageclass hwameistor-storage-lvm-hdd
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```none
    NAME                                   PROVISIONER         RECLAIMPOLICY
    hwameistor-storage-lvm-hdd (default)   lvm.hwameistor.io   Delete
    ```

1. Check `localdisknodes`, the default disk `PHASE` in use is `Bound`.

    ```bash
    kubectl get localdisknodes
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```none
    NAME               NODEMATCH          PHASE
    master01-k8s-com   master01-k8s-com   Bound
    node01-k8s-com     node01-k8s-com     Bound
    node02-k8s-com     node02-k8s-com     Bound
    ```

1. Check `localdisks`, the default disk `PHASE` in use is `Bound`.

    ```bash
    kubectl get localdisks
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```none
    NAME                   NODEMATCH          CLAIM              PHASE
    master01-k8s-com-vda   master01-k8s-com                      Bound
    master01-k8s-com-vdb   master01-k8s-com   master01-k8s-com   Bound
    node01-k8s-com-vda     node01-k8s-com                        Bound
    node01-k8s-com-vdb     node01-k8s-com     node01-k8s-com     Bound
    node02-k8s-com-vda     node02-k8s-com                        Bound
    node02-k8s-com-vdb     node02-k8s-com     node02-k8s-com     Bound
    ```

1. Set the default `StorageClass`

    Added default `annotations` for `storageclasses`.

    ```bash
    kubectl patch storageclasses.storage.k8s.io hwameistor-storage-lvm-hdd -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
    ```

1. Create a storage pool, pay attention to replace the corresponding `nodeName`

    ```bash linenums="1"
    helm template ./hwameistor \
      -s templates/post-install-claim-disks.yaml \
      --set storageNodes='{master01-k8s-com,node01-k8s-com,node02-k8s-com}' \
      | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

    After the creation is successful, check the `ldc` of the local disk, it should all be `Bound`.

    ```bash
    kubectl get ldc
    ```

## Install `Metrics server`

Next, you need to install `metrics-server` for subsequent use of the Insight observability module.
Save the following YAML as `metrics-server.yaml`.

1. Execute the installation command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f metrics-server.yaml
    ```

1. After the installation is successful, run the following command to check the resource usage of node

    ```bash
    kubectl top node
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```none
    NAME               CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
    master01-k8s-com   218m         5%     5610Mi          35%

## Install DCE 5.0 Community Edition

Now everything is ready to install DCE 5.0 Community Edition.

### Install basic dependencies

DCE has provided a one-click installation offline tool dependency package, which has been tested to run relatively stably on `CentOS 7` and `CentOS 8`.
If you are also the two operating systems, you can directly run the following command.

```bash linenums="1"
curl -LO https://proxy-qiniu-download-public.daocloud.io/DaoCloud_Enterprise/dce5/install_prerequisite.sh
chmod +x install_prerequisite.sh
sudo bash install_prerequisite.sh online community
```

Of course, you can also choose to install these dependencies manually:

- podman
- helm ≥ 3.9.4
- skopeo ≥ 1.9.2
- kind
- kubectl ≥ 1.22.0
- yq ≥ 4.27.5
- minio client

### Download dce5-installer

Note that the installation of dce5-installer needs to be performed on the Master node. It is recommended to [download this installer directly](https://docs.daocloud.io/download/dce5/#_1).

After downloading and unpacking the tarball, assuming `VERSION` is v0.3.28:

```bash linenums="1"
export VERSION=v0.3.28
curl -Lo ./dce5-installer  https://proxy-qiniu-download-public.daocloud.io/DaoCloud_Enterprise/dce5/dce5-installer-$VERSION
chmod +x dce5-installer
```

> If `proxy-qiniu-download-public.daocloud.io` link fails, use `qiniu-download-public.daocloud.io`

### Set configuration file [optional]

Save the content of the following configuration file as `clusterConfig.yaml`, if you use `NodePort` to install, you don’t need to specify the configuration file.

```yaml linenums="1"
apiVersion: provision.daocloud.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterConfig
spec:
 loadBalancer: metallb
 istioGatewayVip: 10.6.229.10/32  # 这是 Istio gateway 的 VIP，也是 DCE 5.0 控制台的浏览器访问 IP
 insightVip: 10.6.229.11/32  # 这是全局服务集群的 Insight-Server 采集子集群监控指标的网络路径用的 VIP
```

> If you use configuration files, please note that `MetaLB` needs to be installed in advance, this part needs to be done by yourself.

### Execute the installation

Depending on the actual situation, run one of the following commands:

- when there is no configuration file

    ```bash
    ./dce5-installer install-app
    ```

- when specifying configuration file and loadBalancer

    ```
    ./dce5-installer install-app -c clusterConfig.yaml
    ```

### The installation is complete

If you see the page below, the installation is successful; the default account password is: `admin/changeme`

![Installation succeeded](../install/images/success.png)

## Redirect Portal reverse proxy

Usually the cluster access address after installation is an intranet address.
When the cluster page needs to be opened to public network access, you will find that the login page will automatically redirect to the internal network address. This is because the DCE 5.0 reverse proxy server address is configured by default during installation, and the following modifications are required.

1. Set environment variables

    ```bash
    # Reverse proxy address
    export DCE_PROXY="https://domain:port"

    # helm --set parameter backup file
    export GHIPPO_VALUES_BAK="ghippo-values-bak.yaml"

    # Get the version number of the current ghippo global management
    export GHIPPO_HELM_VERSION=$(helm get notes ghippo -n ghippo-system | grep "Chart Version" | awk -F ': ' '{ print $2 }')
    ```

1. Update the Helm repo

    ```bash
    helm repo update ghippo
    ```

1. Back up `--set` parameter

    ```bash
    helm get values ghippo -n ghippo-system -o yaml > ${GHIPPO_VALUES_BAK}
    ```

1. Use vim command to edit and save

    ```bash
    vim ${GHIPPO_VALUES_BAK}
    ```

    You only need to modify a row:

    ```yaml
    USER-SUPPLIED VALUES:
    ...
    global:
      ...
      reverseProxy: ${DCE_PROXY} # You only need to modify this row
    ```

1. Use heml upgrade to update the configuration

    ```bash
    helm upgrade ghippo ghippo/ghippo \
      -n ghippo-system \
      -f ${GHIPPO_VALUES_BAK} \
      --version ${GHIPPO_HELM_VERSION}
    ```

1. Use kubectl to restart the global management Pod to make the configuration take effect

    ```bash
    kubectl rollout restart deploy/ghippo-apiserver -n ghippo-system
    kubectl rollout restart statefulset/ghippo-keycloak -n ghippo-system
    ```
