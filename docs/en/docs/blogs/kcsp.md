by Kubernetes in August 2022
In the officially organized community [contributor interview] (https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/15/meet-our-contributors-china-ep-03/),
We met with 4 outstanding contributors from the Asia-Pacific region, 2 of whom are from DaoCloud, who have made outstanding contributions to the development of Kubernetes.

While promoting the technological evolution of the community, DaoCloud maintains a keen sense of cloud-native technologies led by Kubernetes.
Taking Kubernetes 1.25 as an example, the first minor version 1.25.1 was released on 2022-09-14, and DaoCloud released it on 2022-10-25 after more than a month of adaptation and debugging.
Submitted [Conformance Certification Application PR](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/pull/2240),
With more than 50,000 lines of real E2E test reports, a complete [Chinese-English document site] (https://docs.daocloud.io/), and detailed materials,
Successfully passed the KCSP review for v1.25 on 2022-11-04.

At present, there are no more than 5 **domestic manufacturers** that can perfectly support Kubernetes 1.25 and have been officially certified.
In view of this, HUAWEI CLOUD has established a strategic partnership with DaoCloud in [Metaverse Cloud Edge Collaborative Hyper-Converged All-in-One Machine] (http://blog.daocloud.io/8542.html). There are also deep partnerships.
