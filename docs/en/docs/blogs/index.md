- [20230518| Having fun with seccomp profiles on the edge](./230518-seccom.md)

    The Security Profiles Operator (SPO) is a feature-rich
    operator for Kubernetes to make managing seccomp, SELinux and
    AppArmor profiles easier than ever. Recording those profiles from scratch is one
    of the key features of this operator, which usually involves the integration
    into large CI/CD systems. Being able to test the recording capabilities of the
    operator in edge cases is one of the recent development efforts of the SPO and
    makes it excitingly easy to play around with seccomp profiles.

- [20230509 | Kubernetes Installation Tutorial (KLTS Version)](./230509-k8s-install.md)

- [20230508 | Cilium Accelerates Sockets with eBPF](./230508-cilium.md)

    With the continuous development of cloud-native technology, more and more applications are deployed on the cloud. Some of these applications have very strict real-time requirements, which requires us to improve their performance to achieve faster service speeds.
    To achieve faster service speeds, a scenario is that when two applications that call each other are deployed on the same node, each request and response must pass through the socket layer, TCP/IP protocol stack, data link layer, and physical layer. 
    If requests and responses bypass the TCP/IP protocol stack and directly redirect data packets to the peer socket at the socket layer, it will greatly reduce the time consumed for sending data packets and increase the speed of the service.
    Based on this idea, eBPF technology maps and stores socket information, and uses helper functions to achieve the ability to redirect data packets to the peer socket layer. Cilium is based on this ability of eBPF to achieve socket acceleration effects.

    This article focuses on methods to speed up Pod startup on the kubelet side. This method does not involve the time period for controller-manager to create Pods through kube-apiserver, 
    nor does it include the scheduling time of Pods or the time to run Webhooks on them.

- [20230427 | Cloud-Native Monitoring - Basics of VictoriaMetrics](./230427-victoriametrics.md)

    When it comes to cloud-native monitoring solutions, the first thing that comes to mind is basically a mature solution set of Prometheus+AlertManager+Grafana.

However, Prometheus is currently not perfect in terms of high availability. For this reason, many alternative and enhanced solutions have emerged in the open source community, and VictoriaMetrics is one of the more outstanding ones. It is a fast, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring solution and time-series database.

- [20221130 | Karmada Resource Interpreter](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DLDmWRmhM_gMVg1qGnj_fA)

    Karmada is increasingly being used by enterprises in multicloud and hybrid cloud cases. In the actual application process, users often encounter use cases where various resources are distributed to member clusters through PropagationPolicy. This requires that the distributed resource types not only include common Kubernetes native or well-known extension resources but also support distribution of custom user-defined resources. Therefore, Karmada introduces a built-in interpreter to parse common Kubernetes native or well-known extension resources, as well as a custom interpreter to interpret the structure of custom resources, and has recently proposed a configurable interpreter scheme. For both custom resources and common Kubernetes native resources, more flexible and configurable custom methods can be provided to extract specific information about resources such as replica numbers and status.

    The emergence of Merbridge CNI mode aims to better adapt to the features of service mesh. When there was no CNI mode before, Merbridge could do relatively little. The biggest problem was that it couldn't adapt to the Sidecar Annotation injected by Istio, which made Merbridge unable to exclude traffic from certain ports or IP ranges. At the same time, because Merbridge only processed connection requests within the Pod before, it meant that if it was external traffic sent to the Pod, Merbridge would not be able to handle it.
