- 20221130 | [Karmada Resource Interpreter](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DLDmWRmhM_gMVg1qGnj_fA)

    Karmada has been adopted by more and more enterprises for use in multicloud and hybrid cloud scenarios. In actual use, users often encounter scenarios where PropagationPolicy is used to distribute various resources to member clusters. This requires that the resource types being distributed not only include common Kubernetes native or well-known extension resources, but also support the distribution of custom resources defined by users. Therefore, Karmada introduces a built-in interpreter to parse common Kubernetes native or well-known extension resources, and also designs a custom interpreter to interpret the structure of custom resources, and recently proposed a configurable interpreter solution. Both custom resources and common Kubernetes native resources can be provided with more flexible and configurable custom methods to extract specified information from resources, such as replica numbers and status.
