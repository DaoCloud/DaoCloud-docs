[K8sGPT](https://k8sgpt.ai/) is an incredible tool that gives Kubernetes SREs superpowers.
It provides a simple and efficient way to scan your Kubernetes clusters and diagnose issues in plain English.
The tool is designed to have SRE experience codified into its analysers, which helps to pull out the
most relevant information and enrich it with AI.

K8sGPT brings you ChatGPT for your K8s platform. It enables you to analyse issues in the cluster
and report them back with suggestions to fix the issue.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure __k8sgpt__ is installed correctly on your environment by following the installation.
2. You need to be connected to any Kubernetes cluster(Minikube, Kind, GKE, EKS, AKS, DIY K8S Clusters).

## Installing K8sgpt

Installing K8sgpt can be done in various ways, but one simple method is by running the brew command.
You can refer to the official [repository](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt) for the relevant commands specific to your platform.

```bash
brew tap k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt
brew install k8sgpt
```

## Quick Start

Are you ready to get started with k8sgpt and analyse your Kubernetes configurations?
 Follow these simple steps to quickly get up and running:

1. Generate an API key from OpenAI by running the command __k8sgpt generate__ .
   This will open a link in your browser to generate the API key. Currently
   the default AI provider is OpenAI but in future you can change to Bard or any other AI.
2. Once you have generated the API key, run __k8sgpt auth__ to set it in k8sgpt.
   You can also provide the API key directly using the __--password__ flag.
3. If you want to manage the active filters used by the analyzer, run __k8sgpt filters__ .
   By default, all filters are executed during analysis.
4. Run __k8sgpt analyze__ to start the scan. This will analyze your Kubernetes configurations
   and provide a summary of any issues found.
5. To get a more detailed explanation of the issues, use the __--explain__ flag with the __k8sgpt analyze__ command.

That’s it! With these simple steps, you can quickly start using k8sgpt to analyze your Kubernetes
configurations and ensure that your clusters are secure and well-optimized.

We can run the following and be able to view the file as a json so that we can understand more.

```bash
k8sgpt analyze -o json - explain - filter=Pod | jq .
```

K8sGPT comes equipped with analyzers to help you detect and troubleshoot issues in your Kubernetes cluster.
These analyzers are included in the platform by default, and some of them are even enabled automatically.
The built-in analyzers consist of podAnalyzer, pvcAnalyzer, rsAnalyzer, serviceAnalyzer, eventAnalyzer,
and ingressAnalyzer. However, you also have the option of adding optional analyzers such as hpaAnalyzer
and pdbAnalyzer. Plus, you can even create your own analyzers to suit your specific needs. With K8sGPT’s
comprehensive set of analyzers, you can ensure that your cluster is always running smoothly and efficiently.

```console
Usage:
  k8sgpt [command]
Available Commands:
  analyze     This command will find problems within your Kubernetes cluster
  auth        Authenticate with your chosen backend
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  filters     Manage filters for analyzing Kubernetes resources
  generate    Generate Key for your chosen backend (opens browser)
  help        Help about any command
  version     Print the version number of k8sgptFlags:
      --config string       config file (default is $HOME/.k8sgpt.git.yaml)
  -h, --help                help for k8sgpt
      --kubeconfig string   Path to a kubeconfig. Only required if out-of-cluster.
      --master string       The address of the Kubernetes API server. Overrides any value in kubeconfig. Only required if out-of-cluster.
  -t, --toggle              Help message for toggleUse "k8sgpt [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

In K8sGPT, filters are used to manage which resources to analyze. You can list the available filters by
running the command __k8sgpt filters list__ . The default filters are already enabled, but you can add or
remove filters as needed. To add filters, run __k8sgpt filters add__ followed by the filter(s) you want to add.
You can add multiple filters by separating them with commas. To remove filters, run __k8sgpt filters remove__ 
followed by the filter(s) you want to remove.

```bash
k8sgpt filters list
```

To add a single filter:

```bash
k8sgpt filters add Service
```

To add multiple filters:

```bash
k8sgpt filters add Ingress,Pod
```

To remove a single filter:

```bash
k8sgpt filters remove Service
```

To remove multiple filters:

```bash
k8sgpt filters remove Ingress,Pod
```

To run a scan with the default analyzers and get a detailed explanation of the issues:

```bash
k8sgpt generate
k8sgpt auth
k8sgpt analyze --explain
```

## Built in analyzers

### Enabled by default

- podAnalyzer
- pvcAnalyzer
- rsAnalyzer
- serviceAnalyzer
- eventAnalyzer
- ingressAnalyzer
- statefulSetAnalyzer
- deploymentAnalyzer
- cronJobAnalyzer
- nodeAnalyzer

### Optional

- hpaAnalyzer
- pdbAnalyzer
- networkPolicyAnalyzer

To filter the results by a specific resource, e.g. “Service”:

```bash
k8sgpt analyze --explain --filter=Service
```

To filter the results by a specific namespace, e.g. “default”:

```bash
k8sgpt analyze --explain --filter=Pod --namespace=default
```

To output the results in JSON format:

```bash
k8sgpt analyze --explain --filter=Service --output=json
```

## Analysis Anonymised

Security is a top priority, so we’ve got your back with the anonymization feature.
This nifty little trick masks sensitive data like Kubernetes object names and labels before sending it to the AI backend for analysis.

This means your data stays safe and sound, and nobody’s peeking where they shouldn’t be.

Here’s how to use anonymization with k8sgpt:

```bash
k8sgpt analyze --explain --anonymize
```

During the analysis, k8sgpt retrieves sensitive data which is then masked before being sent to the AI backend.
The backend receives the masked data, processes it, and returns a solution to the user.

Once the solution is returned to the user, the masked data is replaced with the actual Kubernetes object names and labels.

Note: **anonymization does not apply to events.**

## Integrations command

Did you know that you can integrate other tools with K8SGPT? With the k8sgpt integrations command,
you can easily add and remove these helpful integrations.

First things first, let’s list all available integrations with following command.

```bash
k8sgpt integrations list
```

Next, let's activate an integration by running k8sgpt integration activate followed by the name of the integration you want.
For example, [trivy](https://www.jit.io/lp/automate-cloud-container-security-by-deploying-trivy-lp?utm_term=trivy&utm_campaign=container-scanning&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=1923149435&hsa_cam=19644458103&hsa_grp=148620235329&hsa_ad=647252997090&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-377124710088&hsa_kw=trivy&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAjwrpOiBhBVEiwA_473dDqEQlWIqTEfQb9Z3kVZuaCCbPGE-7eb8_n5Smn6wz96mcipjkD_6hoCyjYQAvD_BwE)
is a popular one that'll install Trivy's Helm chart on the cluster.

```bash
k8sgpt integration activate trivy
```

But wait, there’s more! You can even use these integrations in your analysis by specifying them with
the — filter option. So if you’re using Trivy, just run the following command and watch the magic happen.

```bash
k8sgpt analyze --filter VulnerabilityReport
```

And, if you need to remove an integration, just run the following command followed by the name of the integration.

```bash
k8sgpt integration deactivate trivy
```
