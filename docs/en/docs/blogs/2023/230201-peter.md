!!! tip

     This is a time battlefield without gunpowder smoke, a glorious expedition to expand the territory, an exciting technological climb, and an indomitable retreat :material-sail-boat:

- :leaves:{ .lg .middle } __March in the Spring Breeze__

     ---

     Under the raging epidemic situation in Shanghai,<br>
     Everyone is guarding in their own way,<br>
     Thank you to everyone who is strong and patient, waiting for the flowers to bloom. <br>
     All winters must pass,<br>
     There is not a spring that will not come back.

- :material-virus:{ .lg .middle } __April closed under control__

     ---

     This April, just eat instant noodles üçú, wear pajamas üëî, and look elegant üë®<br>
     Type the code üíª, go to work for a meeting ‚òéÔ∏è, grab food after get off work ü•¨<br>
     There are more antigens than bugs, and git records are longer than your messy hair. <br>
     Even if the epidemic is hazy, even if the surrounding noise is noisy, you can still keep the sunshine üåü<br>
     Persevere, I love you at 105¬∞C.

     In May, all arrows were fired, and the development of the fifth generation has gradually improved. <br>
     Through thin network cables, the four places are connected into one heart, thanks to:<br>

     ```yaml title="Perseverance in the closed city"
     Your Persistence: This magical two months in Shanghai will eventually be included in the historic page of this historic product

     Your demeanor: pages that come alive one by one, linked together, dreams gradually begin to come true

     Your efforts: new technologies come to life, new capabilities are on the horizon, exciting
     ```

- :hugging:{ .lg .middle } __Unblocked in June__

     ---

     Those calm day after day will let you see the meaning of persistence one day.

     When opening the demo-dev site and exclaiming "It's so beautiful, it kills friends and merchants in seconds";<br>
     When your name shines colorfully on the "About" interface;<br>
     When you respond to several months of expectations with real features;<br>
     When I inadvertently planted the seeds of independent open source, one day I suddenly found that the garden was full of flowers.

     My partner: what you love / will one day / embrace you back!

     If you never forget it, there will be echoes, and the merits will not be donated, and Yu Ru will be successful.

     Most things in the world don't make much sense;

     Except truth and love.

     "Man will conquer nature" has always been a misunderstanding against one's will;<br>
     "Rending" actually refers to a firm ambition and victory over oneself. <br>
     So there is nothing inherently like this, only our daily persistence.

     8 months have passed, and the Capture the Flag team welcomes more partners,<br>
     The old comrades lead the way, and the new students strive to keep up. <br>
     Every team has its own highlights, and has also experienced the lows of hiding its strength and biding its time. <br>
     In these 8 months, time answers growth, growth answers dreams, and dreams determine your current appearance:

     ```yaml title="Programmer's Daily"
     The computer you turned off at two o'clock in the middle of the night
       You carefully scrutinize every word in the document
         You're still tossing and turning in bed thinking
           The git commits you still miss in Typhoon
    
     all passion and glory
       In front of the upcoming practice in September
         Will win test and return
           Let's go! To shine / instead of being illuminated!
     ```

     Late at night, you who refuse to admit defeat are still fighting painfully,<br>
     Like a powerless floating in the universe.

     Moving forward in the gully of technology is like being small and lonely in the vast universe;<br>
     You only have a blurry dark world and a clear self.

     But only when it is so dark can you find the stars shining brightly;<br>
     If you have never seen the night, the sunrise will not be so bright and moving.

     Where to go, faith dictates...

- :material-flower-tulip:{ .lg .middle } __October Autumn Breeze__

     ---

     Instead of complaining about being in the dark, it is better to go forward with a lamp;<br>
     Because the most important thing in life is not where you are now, but the direction you are facing.

     Dong Yuhui always said: "Suffering can give us the strength to persevere",<br>
     In fact, the source of strength is the expectation of tomorrow.

     The autumn wind is deep, and the winter is coming. <br>
     But I know: you have an / invincible summer in your heart.

     > Hemingway said:
     >
     > "Life always leaves us bruised and bruised, but in the end, those wounded places must become our strongest places."

     On this scab, may you grow wings and embrace the galaxy thousands of miles away.

     Maybe you may not be / always shining / but always / warm and bright /

- :fontawesome-solid-hourglass-end:{ .lg .middle } __December release control__

     ---

     2022 comes to an end. <br>
     This full stop, with the double challenge of the spirit and body brought about by the virus,<br>
     It also carries the expectation that after three years of the epidemic, everything will be done and everything will be done.

     5.0 It's been another year since Capture the Flag, do you still remember who you were a year ago? <br>
     The bricks you stepped back and forth on the roadside of Songhu day and night,<br>
     In the city of New Jiangwan, you change from green to yellow to bald trees,<br>
     How many times have I vowed never to eat fellow chicken again tomorrow,<br>
     The nucleic acid booth that will disappear forever in front of the park...

     Turn on the computer and face the login interface of Zi Yuedong, and your eyes will be moist;<br>
     It's for the end of the world movie-like 2022,<br>
     It is also for the 12 milestones of staying up day and night this year.

     In the face of an imperfect world, there are always people who choose to stand up. <br>
     To go, to love, to witness. <br>
     It is you, with the courage to overcome the plague and great changes,<br>
     As He Wei said, "Please believe that there are always some good things in the world, which are worth our efforts."<br>
     Difficulties and hardships, Yuru Yucheng!
