# Kubernetes officially released v1.26, the stability has been significantly improved

![1.26 release](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/blogs/images/1.26.png)

On December 8, 2022 Pacific Time, Kubernetes officially released v1.26 with the topic __Electrifying__ .

As the last version in 2022, many new features have been added, and the stability has also been significantly improved. We will introduce the update of version 1.26 from the following perspectives.

Update overview:

- **Kube APIServer:** As the entry point for Kubernetes requests, this update adds 4 new KEP features, and makes some optimizations in response compression, and another 2 features have also been upgraded from Alpha to Beta.
- **Node:** We put the updates most closely related to kubelet here, mainly including 4 new KEP features, and 4 features are GA in this version.
- **Storage:** In terms of storage, the feature of allocating volumes from snapshots of other namespaces (cross-namespaces) has been added, and 2 storage-related features have entered the Beta stage, and 3 features are officially GA.
- **Network:** Mainly updates to Kube Proxy, including a performance-optimized KEP, and 2 features have entered Beta, and 4 features are officially GA.
- **Resource Control and Coordination:** Mainly for the update of related resource controllers in kube-controller-manager, there are also 2 new KEP features, 2 features are upgraded from Alpha to Beta, and 1 This feature is officially GA.
- **Scheduler:** Mainly added an important KEP feature - PodSchedulingReadiness is used to control when a Pod can be scheduled by the scheduler, and one feature has been upgraded from Alpha to Beta.
- **Observability:** In terms of observability, it mainly adds a new mechanism for exposing component status - Component Health SLIs. In addition, many metrics are added to each component.
- **kubectl command, kubeadm and client-go** also have some optimizations and Bug Fixes.
- For features that have been GA, according to the version iteration policy of Kubernetes, **11 feature gates are also removed in 1.26**. If these feature gates are continued to be set in the component command, the component will not start normally.

Next, let's take a look at some of the more important API deprecations and changes that affect upgrades.

## API deprecations and changes

[PR#110618](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110618) Kubelet no longer supports the v1alpha2 version of CRI, and the connected container runtime must implement the v1 version of the container runtime interface.

This means that Kubernetes v1.26 will not support containerd 1.5.x and earlier versions; you need to upgrade to containerd 1.6.x or later before you can upgrade the node's kubelet to 1.26.

[PR#112306](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112306) __flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io__ increases v1beta3 version, and sets v1beta2 as the optimal version, v1beta3 will be set in 1.27 is the optimal version.

[PR#113336](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113336) The __CSIMigrationvSphere__ feature is GA and cannot be turned off.

!!! tip

    Official tip: Do not upgrade to Kubernetes v1.26 if you need to use Windows, XFS or raw blocks. You can upgrade after vSphere CSI Driver adds related support in versions after v2.7.x.

[PR#113710](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113710) The __--pod-eviction-timeoutflag__ in the __kube-controller-manager__ command is deprecated and is compatible with __--enable- taint-managerflag__ was removed in 1.27.

[PR#112643](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112643) __DynamicKubeletConfig__ is deprecated in 1.23, the logic in kubelet has been removed in 1.24, this update will __FeatureGateDynamicKubeletConfig__ and APIServer The logic within is removed.

[PR#112120](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112120) Remove some invalid klog related flags in Kube component.

## Kubernetes APIServer

### KEP-2799 Reduction of Secret-based Service Account Tokens

Added Alpha Feature Gate —— __LegacyServiceAccountTokenTracking__ to control whether to enable this feature.

When __LegacyServiceAccountTokenTracking__ is enabled, the secret-based sa token will use the label __kubernetes.io/legacy-token-last-used__ to record the last usage time.

### KEP-3488 CEL for Admission Control

Related PRs: [PR#113314](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113314),
[PR#113349](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113349),
[PR#112994](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112994),
[PR#112792](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112792),
[PR#112926](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112926),
[PR#112858](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112858)

Based on the KEP-2876 CRD validation expression language provided by Kubernetes v1.25,
This feature adds a new resource under __admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1__ -
 __ValidatingAdmissionPolicy__ , which allows field validation when not using a Validation Webhook.

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: "demo-policy.example.com"
spec:
  failurePolicy: Fail
  matchConstraints:
    resourceRules:
      - apiGroups: ["apps"]
        apiVersions: ["v1"]
        operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
        resources: ["deployments"]
  validations:
    - expression: "object.spec.replicas <= 5"
```

This will require the resource's spec.replicas field to be less than or equal to 5.

**Added Alpha Feature Gate** —— __ValidatingAdmissionPolicy__ to control whether to enable this feature

### KEP-3352 Aggregated Discovery [PR#113171](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113171)

Currently, users can only traverse the Group and Version APIs to obtain the Discovery API, but this feature reduces these calls to only two interfaces: /api and /apis.

**Added Alpha Feature Gate** —— __AggregatedDiscoveryEndpoint__ to control whether to enable this feature.

### KEP-3325 Auth API to get self user attributes [PR#111333](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111333)

Add resource __SelfSubjectReview__ in __authentication/v1alpha1__ group to provide users with querying their own user information mapped in Kubernetes.

And the __kubectl alpha auth whoami__ command has been added to facilitate query.

```shell
kubectl alpha auth whoami -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: SelfSubjectReview
status:
  userInfo:
    username: jane.doe
    uid: b79dbf30-0c6a-11ed-861d-0242ac120002
    groups:
      - students
      - teachers
      - system:authenticated
    extra:
      skills:
        - reading
        - learning
      subjects:
        - math
        - sports
```

**Added Alpha Feature Gate** —— __APISelfSubjectAttributesReview__ to control whether to enable this feature.

[PR#112193](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112193) APIServer adds __--aggregator-reject-forwarding-redirect__ flag,
Users can set it to false to continue forwarding the redirection response of AA (Aggregated API) Server, the default is true.

[PR#113015](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113015) You can specify custom resources through the __--encryption-provider-config__ file, and these custom resources can be stored encrypted in etcd .

### Response Compression

[PR#112299](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112299) Based on load testing and production data collected from thousands of production Kubernetes clusters, the community observed that gzip compression in Kubernetes APIServer is currently suboptimal.

ISSUE: kubernetes/kubernetes#112296

[PR#112309](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112309) Add __DisableCompression__ field in kubeconfig, when set to true, it is required to no longer compress the response.

[PR#112580](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112580) Add __--disable-compression__ flag in kubectl, when set to true, request no longer compress the response.

### Function stability upgrade

Alpha -> Beta

| **Feature Gate** | **KEP** |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration | KEP-2799 Reduction of Secret-based Service Account Tokens |
| APIServerIdentity | KEP-1965 kube-apiserver identity |

## Node (Kubelet)

### KEP-3063 dynamic resource allocation [PR#111023](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111023)

Add resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1 group and add resources related to dynamic resource allocation under this group: 'ResourceClaim', 'ResourceClass', 'ResourceClaimTemplate', 'PodScheduling'.

**Added Alpha Feature Gate** —— __DynamicResourceAllocation__ to control whether to enable this feature.

The new API is more flexible than Kubernetes' existing Device Plugins functionality, because it allows Pods to request special types of resources, which can be provided at the node level, cluster level, or according to other modes set by the user.

Similarly, the Pod structure also adds corresponding support for dynamic resource allocation.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: with-resource
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "set && mount && ls -la /dev/"]
      resources:
        claims:
          - name: resource
  resourceClaims:
    - name: resource
      source:
        resourceClaimName: shared-claim
        # resourceClaimTemplateName: test-inline-claim-template
```

### KEP-3545 Improved multi-numa alignment in Topology Manager [PR#112914](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112914)

This feature better handles NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) nodes by optimizing the TopologyManager.

Add a new configurable item __topologyManagerPolicyOptions__ field and
__--topology-manager-policy-options__ flag to set additional configuration for Topology Manager Policy.

And add three Alpha feature gates to control the configuration of Topology Manager Policy:

- __TopologyManagerPolicyOptions__
- __TopologyManagerPolicyAlphaOptions__
- __TopologyManagerPolicyBetaOptions__

__TopologyManagerPolicyOptions__ controls whether the __TopologyManagerPolicyOptions__ feature is supported, and the other two are used to control whether the Alpha and Beta level Options of __TopologyManagerPolicy__ can be set respectively.

Of course, to use the __TopologyManager__ function, you need to enable the __TopologyManager__ Feature Gate, but the Feature Gate is already in the Beta stage and does not need to be actively set.

### KEP-3386 Kubelet Evented PLEG for Better Performance [PR#111384](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111384)

This feature allows kubelet to reduce periodic polling by relying as much as possible on notifications from the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) when tracking Pod status in a node, which reduces kubelet's CPU usage

**Added Alpha Feature Gate** —— EventedPLEG to control whether to enable this feature.

[PR#86139](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/86139) In past versions, when using httpGet in container preStop and postStart lifecycle callbacks,
Even if the schemes are set to HTTPS, http is still used to access, and the headers set by the user will not be applied in the setting request.

```yaml
lifecycle:
  postStart:
    httpGet:
      port: 443
      scheme: HTTPS
    httpHandlers:
      - name: HEADER
        value: VALUE
```

This PR fixes these problems, and when the https access is abnormal, it will fall back to the http request. When the fallback occurs,
A __LifecycleHTTPFallback__ event is created for the Pod and the __kubelet_lifecycle_handler_http_fallbacks_total__ metric is updated.

In addition, **Added an Alpha Feature Gate** - __ConsistentHTTPGetHandlers__ , users can set __--feature-gates=ConsistentHTTPGetHandlers=false__ in the kubelet to turn off the fallback behavior.

### KEP-3503 Windows allows specifying whether a Pod is added to a node's network namespace [PR#112961](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112961)

**Added Alpha Feature Gate** —— __WindowsHostNetworking__ to control whether to enable this feature.

[PR#112414](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112414) allows to combine multiple line options in __/etc/resolv.conf__ into a single line setting in Pod.

```go
options ndots:1 attempts:3
options ndots:1 attempts:3 ndots:5
```

changed to:

```go
options ndots:5 attempts:3
```

### BUG FIX

[PR#113041](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113041) Fixed kubectl exec causing kubelet to pick wrong container due to duplicate container name due to __lifecycle.preStop__ .

[PR#108832](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108832) When the container sets limit.cpu, but requests.cpu is "0", cgroups cpuShares takes the minimum value of 2 instead of using limit.cpu.

[PR#112184](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112184) When kubelet only sets __--cloud-provider__ or __--node-ip__ , it will ensure that invalid annotations in the node are cleared - __alpha.kubernetes.io/provided-node-ip__ .

[PR#113481](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113481) Fix __kubectl logs --timestamps__ when viewing logs, the problem of confusing random timestamps appears.

[PR#112518](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112518) Fixed an issue where pods would continue to run on nodes tainted with NoExecute taints when the __PodDisruptionConditions__ feature gate was enabled.

[PR#112123](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112123) Set the minimum value of __cpuCFSQuotaPeriod__ from 1us to 1ms, setting the value below 1ms will fail the verification.

#### KEP-3294 Provision volumes from cross-namespace snapshots

Related PRs: PR#[113186](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113186), PR#kubernetes-csi/external-rpovisioner#805

Prior to Kubernetes 1.26, with __VolumeSnapshot__ , users could allocate volumes from snapshots. But it fails to bind to VolumeSnapshots in other namespaces in a PersistentVolumeClaim .

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
spec:
  storageClassName: csi-hostpath-sc
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  dataSourceRef:
    apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
    kind: VolumeSnapshot
    name: new-snapshot-demo
    namespace: prod
  volumeMode: Filesystem
```

This feature supports users to allocate volumes from snapshots across namespaces by setting the newly added field __spec.dataSourceRef.namespace__ in PVC

**Added Alpha Feature Gate** —— __CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource__ to control whether to enable this feature

## Resource Control and Coordination

### KEP-3017 PodHealthyPolicy for PodDisruptionBudget [PR#113375](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113375)

Added spec.unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy field to PodDisruptionBudget resource to control when unhealthy Pods should be considered for eviction.

The spec.unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy field currently has two values that can be set - IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow

```yaml
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: zookeeper
  unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy: IfHealthyBudget
```

**Add Alpha Feature Gate** —— PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy to control whether to enable this feature

### KEP-3335 StatefulSet Start Ordinal [PR#112744](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112744)

StatefulSets currently number pods starting at 0.

This feature adds a spec.ordinals.start field to StatefulSet to control the starting number of Pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
spec:
  ordinals:
    start: 1
```

**Add Alpha Feature Gate** —— StatefulSetStartOrdinal to control whether to enable this feature

[PR#112011](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112011) Stops working if multiple HPAs involve the same pod,

## Pod Scheduling

#### KEP-3521 Pod Scheduling Readiness

Related PR: [PR#113275](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113275),
[PR#113274](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113274),
[PR#113442](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113442)

Not all Pods in the Pending state are ready to be scheduled, and some Pods cannot be successfully scheduled due to the lack of necessary resources, which will also bring additional work to the scheduler.

This feature adds the spec.schedulingGates field in the Pod to control whether the Pod is ready for actual scheduling.

```yaml
spec:
  scheduling Gates:
  - name: <value>
```

Scheduling will only start if spec.schedulingGates is cleared:

```shell
$ kubectl get pod example-po
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
example-po 0/1 SchedulingGated 0 30s
```

**Added Alpha Feature Gate** —— PodSchedulingReadiness to control whether to enable this feature

[PR#111726](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111726) Output Pending status Pod information in the Scheduler's debug Dummer.

### Optimization and BUG FIX

[PR#111809](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111809) When using Patch to update Pod status,
In addition to __net.ConnectionRefused__ , retries are also performed on __ServiceUnavailable__ and __InternalError__ errors.

The __ServiceUnavailable__ error occurs when the APIServer is temporarily unable to process a request.

> E0805 20:54:21.624945 123623 scheduler.go:356] Error updating pod foo: the server is currently unable to handle the request (patch pods foo)

InternalError usually occurs due to a temporary failure of the webhook.

> E0811 23:32:30.886582 213747 scheduler.go:357] Error updating pod foo: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "xyz": Post "xyz": context deadline exceeded

## Observability

#### KEP-3466 Kubernetes Component Health SLIs

There was no standard format to expose the health information of Kubernetes components before. This feature adds a new path /metrics/slis to each component to expose the service level metric (ServiceLevelIndicator) in the Prometheus format.

Every component needs to expose two metrics:

- gauge: the current health check status of the component

     ```shell
     # HELP kubernetes_healthcheck [ALPHA] This metric records the result of a single healthcheck.
     # TYPE kubernetes_healthcheck gauge
     kubernetes_healthcheck{name="etcd", type="healthz"} 1
     kubernetes_healthcheck{name="etcd", type="readyz"} 1
     ```

- counter: Cumulative count of detected states for each health check

     ```shell
     # HELP kubernetes_healthchecks_total [ALPHA] This metric records the results of all healthchecks.
     # TYPE kubernetes_healthchecks_total counter
     kubernetes_healthchecks_total{name="etcd", status="success", type="healthz"} 15
     kubernetes_healthchecks_total{name="etcd", status="success", type="readyz"} 15
     ```
