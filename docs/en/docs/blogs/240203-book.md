# Book Recommendation: "Managing Cloud Native Data on Kubernetes"

On New Year's Day in 2024, internationally renowned technology book publisher O'Reilly Media quietly launched
a professional book on Kubernetes data storage in collaboration with China Electronics Industry Publishing House:
[Managing Cloud Native Data on Kubernetes](https://www.oreilly.com.cn/index.php?func=book&isbn=978-7-121-47005-9).
It primarily introduces how to manage data storage through Kubernetes, how to automatically deploy and manage
databases on Kubernetes using Helm and Operator, explains the process of data streaming and data analysis, and
explores how to use Kubernetes to manage cloud native data in emerging use cases such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Preface

This book will take you deep into the core area of the biggest technological revolution and embark on a wonderful adventure.

In just a few decades, IT infrastructure has evolved from mainframes to the internet, then to data centers,
cloud construction, and now the wildfire of artificial intelligence. Each era feels like a new world, constantly
emerging with new rules and opportunities. People strive to build an ecosystem that meets the requirements of
the times; and these systems, in turn, accelerate the pace of progress, giving rise to more IT systems.
Although the era is developing rapidly, people's pursuit of technology is insatiable, which will gradually
lead to qualitative changes from quantitative changes, triggering a new round of technological breakthroughs and opening up a new era.

Kubernetes is the prodigy of more than a decade, and like other legendary journeys, the development of Kubernetes
cloud native data is a gradual process. It was born on traditional data storage facilities and guides people to
master the ability to build data infrastructure for any workload through StatefulSets, whether it is
applications, data analysis, or machine learning, Kubernetes can open the door to an extraordinary world.

The prosperity of the current ecosystem was once the vision of the next generation of data management.
This open-source container orchestration project ignited the rapid development of large-scale cluster data
management. With the concept of open community code sharing, co-construction, and cooperation, new IT practitioners have discovered a path to the future.

Looking ahead to the next decade, people do not know what the technology they are using will be called,
but they are certain that they will be built on the ideas currently being realized. Welcome to join the
adventure of cloud native data and enjoy the fulfillment and joy brought by this journey!

## Translation Team and Their Projects

The original English version of this book is [Managing Cloud Native Data on Kubernetes](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-cloud native-Data-Kubernetes/dp/1098111397),
consisting of 11 chapters and nearly 300 pages. As a project team of [CNCF Sandbox cloud native Storage Quadrant](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=hwamei-stor),
the open-source team HwameiStor, based on their own development practices and profound experience, was authorized
by China Electronics Industry Publishing House to be responsible for the translation of this book from English
to Chinese. The translation, proofreading, and typesetting of the entire text amounted to 240,000 Chinese characters.

HwameiStor is an open-source project built on Kubernetes, which was voted into CNCF Sandbox in June 2023.
Its team members mainly come from [DaoCloud](https://www.daocloud.io/). Here is a brief introduction to HwameiStor.

HwameiStor is a Kubernetes-native Container Attached Storage (CAS) solution that unifies HDD, SSD, and NVMe
disks into a local storage resource pool for centralized management. It provides distributed local data volume
services using the CSI architecture, offering data persistence capabilities for stateful cloud native applications or components.

This open-source, lightweight, and cost-effective local storage system can replace expensive traditional
SAN storage. The system architecture of HwameiStor is as follows:

The key features include:

- Automated operation and maintenance management
- Highly available data
- Rich data volume types
- Flexible and dynamic linear scalability

## Efforts and Contributions

As a professional book on cloud native storage, "Managing Cloud Native Data on Kubernetes" required significant
efforts from the HwameiStor team to reach publishing standards and be widely accepted by cloud native
practitioners in China. From different perspectives of project team members, let us tell you the story behind this book.

[Dr. Liang Sun](https://github.com/sun7927) is a senior expert in the storage field with more than 20 years of experience in storage
technology. He is the Lead of the HwameiStor team, responsible for guiding development direction and
architecture design. Dr. Sun was in charge of the later proofreading of this book, wrote the preface, and provided many insightful opinions.

[Simon Zhao](https://github.com/zhaosimon) is responsible for expanding various storage solutions for HwameiStor
and collaborating with the CNCF community. He translated the 7th chapter of this book, "Kubernetes Native Database,"
and also proofread several other chapters. In March 2024, at the European KubeCon held in Paris, France, Simon
will represent the HwameiStor team to deliver a keynote speech titled "Accelerate Kubernetes Data-Intensive Apps with CloudNative Local Storage & Distribute Cache System." In the era of booming artificial intelligence, he will promote the high availability and high-performance containerized local storage solution: HwameiStor to the world.

[Michael Yao](https://github.com/windsonsea) is responsible for the development of the Chinese and English documentation on [hwameistor.io](https://hwameistor.io/). Starting with the selection of the Docusaurus compiler, he has been involved in the construction of the entire website, responsible for the writing and maintenance of the Chinese and English content, providing a user-friendly entry point for user experience and development contributions. He is the Chinese Owner and English Reviewer of [k8s.io](https://kubernetes.io/), a Chinese Maintainer of [istio.io](https://istio.io/), and a documentation Reviewer of [karmada.io](https://karmada.io/). He translated the 1st chapter, "cloud native Data Infrastructure," and the 9th chapter, "Kubernetes Data Analysis," of this book, and planned and summarized the translation and proofreading work for the entire book. He believes that the inheritance of technology knows no borders, but to spread culture well, a lot of effort needs to be put into the presentation of knowledge, ensuring accurate and readable text and images.

[Michelle Wu](https://github.com/Michelle951) studied translation during her undergraduate and master's degrees and obtained the authoritative CATTI Level 1 Translation Certificate in China. She has years of experience in translating and proofreading millions of words. In addition, she has been involved in technical document writing and translation work in the cloud native industry for many years and has acquired a certain amount of professional knowledge in cloud computing and cloud native. In the translation process of this book, she was responsible for translating and proofreading most of the chapters, unifying the overall writing style. Within more than six months, she communicated and coordinated with multiple parties to ensure the orderly progress of the translation work for the entire book, ultimately completing all the work within the scheduled timeframe.

[Jeanine Zhu](https://github.com/Jeanine-tw) also graduated from the English translation major and has been working on documentation writing, translation, and research related to the cloud native networking project [Spiderpool](https://spidernet-io.github.io/) for many years. She is meticulous and has a deep understanding. She efficiently translated the 10th chapter, "Machine Learning and Other Emerging Use Cases," the 11th chapter, "Migrating Data Workloads to Kubernetes," and the appendix's content. She also carefully proofread several other chapters, making significant contributions to the publication of the book.

## Conclusion

Books are the crystallization of human wisdom and an important source for broadening horizons, enlightening minds, and inspiring creativity. Let us explore the deep waters of Kubernetes technology together through this authoritative material from the official community and learn how to build cloud native data services using open-source technology. Open it and get up close with cutting-edge technology, embark on this journey of exploration together!
