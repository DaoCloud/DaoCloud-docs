# Vulnerability Scan

To use the [Vulnerability Scan](index.md) feature, you need to create a scan policy first. After executing the policy, a scan report will be automatically generated for viewing.

## Create a Scan Policy

1. On the left navigation bar of the homepage in the Container Management module, click __Security Management__ .



2. Click __Vulnerability Scan__ on the left navigation bar, then click the __Scan Policy__ tab and click __Create Scan Policy__ on the right.


3. Fill in the configuration according to the following instructions, and then click __OK__ .

    - Cluster: Select the cluster to be scanned. The optional cluster list comes from the clusters accessed or created in the [Container Management](../../intro/index.md) module. If the desired cluster is not available, you can access or create a cluster in the Container Management module.
    - Scan Type:

        - Immediate scan: Perform a scan immediately after the scan policy is created. It cannot be automatically/manually executed again later.
        - Scheduled scan: Automatically repeat the scan at scheduled intervals.

    - Number of Scan Reports to Keep: Set the maximum number of scan reports to be kept. When the specified retention quantity is exceeded, delete from the earliest report.


## Update/Delete Scan Policies

After creating a scan policy, you can update or delete it as needed.

Under the __Scan Policy__ tab, click the __â”‡__ action button to the right of a configuration:

- For periodic scan policies:

    - Select __Execute Immediately__ to perform an additional scan outside the regular schedule.
    - Select __Disable__ to interrupt the scanning plan until __Enable__ is clicked to resume executing the scan policy according to the scheduling plan.
    - Select __Edit__ to update the configuration. You can update the scan configuration, type, scan cycle, and report retention quantity. The configuration name and the target cluster to be scanned cannot be changed.
    - Select __Delete__ to delete the configuration.

- For one-time scan policies: Only support the __Delete__ operation.



## Viewe Scan Reports

1. Under the __Security Management__ -> __Vulnerability Scanning__ -> __Scan Reports__ tab, click the report name.

    > Clicking __Delete__ on the right of a report allows you to manually delete the report.


2. View the scan report content, including:

    - The target cluster scanned.
    - The scan policy used.
    - The scan frequency.
    - The total number of risks, high risks, medium risks, and low risks.
    - The time of the scan.
    - Check details such as vulnerability ID, vulnerability type, vulnerability name, vulnerability description, etc.
