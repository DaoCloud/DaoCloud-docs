# Start Cluster Inspection

After creating an inspection configuration, if the __Scheduled Inspection__ configuration is enabled, inspections will be automatically executed at the specified time. If the __Scheduled Inspection__ configuration is not enabled, you need to manually trigger the inspection.

This page explains how to manually perform a cluster inspection.

## Prerequisites

- [Integrate](../clusters/integrate-cluster.md) or [create](../clusters/create-cluster.md) a cluster in the Container Management module.
- Create an [inspection configuration](config.md).
- The selected cluster is in the __Running__ state and the insight component has been [installed in the cluster](../../../insight/quickstart/install/install-agent.md).

## Steps

When performing an inspection, you can choose to inspect multiple clusters in batches or perform a separate inspection for a specific cluster.

=== "Batch Inspection"

    1. Click __Cluster Inspection__ in the top-level navigation bar of the Container Management module, then click __Inspection__ on the right side of the page.

    2. Select the clusters you want to inspect, then click __OK__ at the bottom of the page.

        - If you choose to inspect multiple clusters at the same time, the system will perform inspections based on different inspection configurations for each cluster.
        - If no inspection configuration is set for a cluster, the system will use the default configuration.

=== "Individual Inspection"

    1. Go to the Cluster Inspection page.
    2. Click the more options button ( __â”‡__ ) on the right of the corresponding inspection configuration, then select __Inspection__ from the popup menu.
