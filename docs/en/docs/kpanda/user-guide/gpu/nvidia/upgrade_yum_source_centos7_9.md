## Build CentOS 7.9 Offline Yum Source

## Use Case Overview

DCE 5 comes with a pre-installed GPU Operator offline package for CentOS 7.9 with kernel version 3.10.0-1160.
or other OS types or kernel versions, users need to manually build an offline yum source.

This guide explains how to build an offline yum source for CentOS 7.9 with a specific kernel version and use it when installing the GPU Operator by specifying the __RepoConfig.ConfigMapName__ parameter.

## Prerequisites

1. The user has already installed the v0.12.0 or later version of the addon offline package on the platform.
1. Prepare a file server that is accessible from the cluster network, such as Nginx or MinIO.
1. Prepare a node that has internet access, can access the cluster where the GPU Operator will
   be deployed, and can access the file server. Docker should also be installed on this node.
   You can refer to [Installing Docker](../../../../install/community/kind/online.md#install-docker) for installation instructions.

## Procedure

This guide uses CentOS 7.9 with kernel version 3.10.0-1160.95.1.el7.x86_64 as an example to explain how to upgrade the pre-installed GPU Operator offline package's yum source.

### Check OS and Kernel Versions of Cluster Nodes

Run the following commands on both the control node of the Global cluster and the node where
GPU Operator will be deployed. If the OS and kernel versions of the two nodes are consistent,
there is no need to build a yum source. You can directly refer to the
[Offline Installation of GPU Operator](./install_nvidia_driver_of_operator.md) document for
installation. If the OS or kernel versions of the two nodes are not consistent,
please proceed to the [next step](#create-the-offline-yum-source).

1. Run the following command to view the distribution name and version of the node where GPU Operator will be deployed in the cluster.

    ```bash
    cat /etc/redhat-release
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    CentOS Linux release 7.9 (Core)
    ```

    The output shows the current node's OS version as `CentOS 7.9`.

2. Run the following command to view the kernel version of the node where GPU Operator will be deployed in the cluster.

    ```bash
    uname -a
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    Linux localhost.localdomain 3.10.0-1160.95.1.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Oct 19 16:18:59 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    ```

    The output shows the current node's kernel version as `3.10.0-1160.el7.x86_64`.

### Create the Offline Yum Source

Perform the following steps on a node that has internet access and can access the file server:

1. Create a script file named __yum.sh__ by running the following command:

    ```bash
    vi yum.sh
    ```

    Then press the **i** key to enter insert mode and enter the following content:

    ```bash
    export TARGET_KERNEL_VERSION=$1

    cat >> run.sh << \EOF
    #! /bin/bash
    echo "start install kernel repo"
    echo ${KERNEL_VERSION}
    mkdir centos-base

    if [ "$OS" -eq 7 ]; then
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base perl
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base elfutils-libelf.x86_64
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./redhat-base elfutils-libelf-devel.x86_64
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base kernel-headers-${KERNEL_VERSION}.el7.x86_64
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base kernel-devel-${KERNEL_VERSION}.el7.x86_64
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base kernel-${KERNEL_VERSION}.el7.x86_64
        yum install  -y --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base groff-base
    elif [ "$OS" -eq 8 ]; then
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base perl
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base elfutils-libelf.x86_64
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./redhat-base elfutils-libelf-devel.x86_64
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base kernel-headers-${KERNEL_VERSION}.el8.x86_64
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base kernel-devel-${KERNEL_VERSION}.el8.x86_64
        yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base kernel-${KERNEL_VERSION}.el8.x86_64
        yum install  -y --downloadonly --downloaddir=./centos-base groff-base
    else
        echo "Error os version"
    fi

    createrepo centos-base/
    ls -lh centos-base/
    tar -zcf centos-base.tar.gz centos-base/
    echo "end install kernel repo"
    EOF

    cat >> Dockerfile << EOF
    FROM centos:7
    ENV KERNEL_VERSION=""
    ENV OS=7
    RUN yum install -y createrepo
    COPY run.sh .
    ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash","run.sh"]
    EOF

    docker build -t test:v1 -f Dockerfile .
    docker run -e KERNEL_VERSION=$TARGET_KERNEL_VERSION --name centos7.9 test:v1
    docker cp centos7.9:/centos-base.tar.gz .
    tar -xzf centos-base.tar.gz
    ```

    Press the __Esc__ key to exit insert mode, then enter __:wq__ to save and exit.

2. Run the __yum.sh__ file:

    ```bash
    bash -x yum.sh TARGET_KERNEL_VERSION
    ```

    The `TARGET_KERNEL_VERSION` parameter is used to specify the kernel version of the cluster nodes.
    
    Note: You don't need to include the distribution identifier (e.g., __ .el7.x86_64__ ).
    For example:

    ```bash
    bash -x yum.sh 3.10.0-1160.95.1
    ```

Now you have generated an offline yum source, __centos-base__ ,
for the kernel version __3.10.0-1160.95.1.el7.x86_64__ .

### Upload the Offline Yum Source to the File Server

Perform the following steps on a node that has internet access and can access the file server.
This step is used to upload the generated yum source from the previous step to a file server
that can be accessed by the cluster where the GPU Operator will be deployed. The file server
can be Nginx, MinIO, or any other file server that supports the HTTP protocol.

In this example, we will use the built-in MinIO in DCE5 as the file server. The MinIO details are as follows:

- Access URL: `http://10.5.14.200:9000` (usually __{bootstrap-node IP} + {port-9000}__ )
- Login username: rootuser
- Login password: rootpass123

1. Run the following command in the current directory of the node to establish a connection between the node's local __mc__ command-line tool and the MinIO server:

    ```bash
    mc config host add minio http://10.5.14.200:9000 rootuser rootpass123
    ```

    The expected output should resemble the following:

    ```bash
    Added __minio__ successfully.
    ```

    __mc__ is the command-line tool provided by MinIO for interacting with the MinIO server. For more details, refer to the [MinIO Client](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html) documentation.

2. In the current directory of the node, create a bucket named __centos-base__ :

    ```bash
    mc mb -p minio/centos-base
    ```

    The expected output should resemble the following:

    ```bash
    Bucket created successfully __minio/centos-base__ .
    ```

3. Set the access policy of the bucket __centos-base__ to allow public download. This will enable access during the installation of the GPU Operator:

    ```bash
    mc anonymous set download minio/centos-base
    ```

    The expected output should resemble the following:

    ```bash
    Access permission for __minio/centos-base__ is set to __download__ 
    ```

4. In the current directory of the node, copy the generated __centos-base__ offline yum source to the __minio/centos-base__ bucket on the MinIO server:

    ```bash
    mc cp centos-base minio/centos-base --recursive
    ```

### Create a ConfigMap to Store the Yum Source Info in the Cluster

Perform the following steps on the control node of the cluster where the GPU Operator will be deployed.

1. Run the following command to create a file named __CentOS-Base.repo__ that specifies the configmap for the yum source storage:

    ```bash
    # The file name must be CentOS-Base.repo, otherwise it cannot be recognized during the installation of the GPU Operator
    cat > CentOS-Base.repo << EOF
    [extension-0]
    baseurl = http://10.5.14.200:9000/centos-base/centos-base # The file server address where the yum source is placed in step 3
    gpgcheck = 0
    name = kubean extension 0
    
    [extension-1]
    baseurl = http://10.5.14.200:9000/centos-base/centos-base # The file server address where the yum source is placed in step 3
    gpgcheck = 0
    name = kubean extension 1
    EOF
    ```

2. Based on the created __CentOS-Base.repo__ file, create a configmap named __local-repo-config__ in the __gpu-operator__ namespace:

    ```bash
    kubectl create configmap local-repo-config  -n gpu-operator --from-file=CentOS-Base.repo=/etc/yum.repos.d/extension.repo
    ```

    The expected output should resemble the following:

    ```
    configmap/local-repo-config created
    ```

    The __local-repo-config__ configmap will be used to provide the value for the __RepoConfig.ConfigMapName__ parameter during the installation of the GPU Operator. You can customize the configuration file name.

3. View the content of the __local-repo-config__ configmap:

    ```bash
    kubectl get configmap local-repo-config -n gpu-operator -oyaml
    ```

    The expected output should resemble the following:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
    CentOS-Base.repo: "[extension-0]\nbaseurl = http://10.6.232.5:32618/centos-base# The file server path where the yum source is placed in step 2\ngpgcheck = 0\nname = kubean extension 0\n  \n[extension-1]\nbaseurl = http://10.6.232.5:32618/centos-base # The file server path where the yum source is placed in step 2\ngpgcheck = 0\nname = kubean extension 1\n"
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
    creationTimestamp: "2023-10-18T01:59:02Z"
    name: local-repo-config
    namespace: gpu-operator
    resourceVersion: "59445080"
    uid: c5f0ebab-046f-442c-b932-f9003e014387
    ```

You have successfully created an offline yum source configuration file for the cluster where the
GPU Operator will be deployed. You can use it during the [offline installation of the GPU Operator](./install_nvidia_driver_of_operator.md)
by specifying the __RepoConfig.ConfigMapName__ parameter.
