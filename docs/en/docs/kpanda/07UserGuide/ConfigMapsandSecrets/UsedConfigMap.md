# ConfigMap

ConfigMap (ConfigMap) is an API object of Kubernetes, which is used to save non-confidential data into key-value pairs, and can store configurations that other objects need to use.
When used, the container can use it as an environment variable, a command-line argument, or a configuration file in a storage volume. By using ConfigMaps, configuration data and application code can be separated, providing a more flexible way to modify application configuration.

!!! note

    ConfigMaps do not provide confidentiality or encryption. If the data to be stored is confidential, please use [secret](use-secret.md), or use other third-party tools to ensure the privacy of the data instead of ConfigMaps.
    In addition, when using ConfigMaps in containers, the container and ConfigMaps must be in the same cluster namespace.

## scenes to be used

You can use ConfigMaps in Pods. There are many usage scenarios, mainly including:

- Use ConfigMaps to set the environment variables of the container

- Use ConfigMaps to set the command line parameters of the container

- Use ConfigMaps as container data volumes

## Use ConfigMaps to set the environment variables of the container

You can use the ConfigMap as the environment variable of the container through the graphical interface or the terminal command line.

!!! note

    The ConfigMap import is to use the ConfigMap as the value of the environment variable; the ConfigMap key value import is to use a certain parameter in the ConfigMap as the value of the environment variable.

### Graphical interface operation

When creating a workload through an image, you can set environment variables for the container by selecting `Import ConfigMaps` or `Import ConfigMap Key Values` on the `Environment Variables` interface.

1. Enter the [Image Creation Workload](../Workloads/CreateDeploymentByImage.md) page, in the `Container Configuration` step, select the `Environment Variables` configuration, and click the `Add Environment Variable` button.

2. Select `ConfigMap Import` or `ConfigMap Key Value Import` in the environment variable type.

    - When the environment variable type is selected as `ConfigMap import`, enter `variable name`, `prefix` name, `ConfigMap` name in sequence.

    - When the environment variable type is selected as `ConfigMap key-value import`, enter `variable name`, `ConfigMap` name, and `key` name in sequence.

### Command line operation

You can set ConfigMaps as environment variables when creating a workload, using the valueFrom parameter to refer to the Key/Value in the ConfigMap.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-pod-1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: busybox
      command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "env" ]
      env:
        - name: SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY
          valueFrom: ##Use valueFrom to specify the value of the env reference ConfigMap
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: kpanda-configmap ##Referenced configuration file name
              key: SPECIAL_LEVEL ##referenced ConfigMap key
  restartPolicy: Never
```

## Use ConfigMaps to set the command line parameters of the container

You can use ConfigMaps to set the command or parameter value in the container, and use the environment variable substitution syntax `$(VAR_NAME)` to do so. As follows.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-pod-3
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: busybox
      command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "echo $(SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY) $(SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY)" ]
      env:
        - name: SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: kpanda-configmap
              key: SPECIAL_LEVEL
        - name: SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: kpanda-configmap
              key: SPECIAL_TYPE
  restartPolicy: Never
```

After the Pod runs, the output is as follows.

```none
Hello Kpanda
```

## Use the ConfigMap as the data volume of the container

You can use the ConfigMap as the environment variable of the container through the graphical interface or the terminal command line.

### Graphical operation

When creating a workload through an image, you can use the ConfigMap as the data volume of the container by selecting the storage type as "ConfigMap" on the "Data Storage" interface.

1. Enter the [Image Creation Workload](../Workloads/CreateDeploymentByImage.md) page, in the `Container Configuration` step, select the `Data Storage` configuration, and click the `Add` button in the `Node Path Mapping` list .

    ![Add environment variable](../../images/config06.png)

2. Select `ConfigMap` in the storage type, and enter `container path`, `subpath` and other information in sequence.

### Command line operation

To use a ConfigMap in a Pod's storage volume.

Here is an example Pod that mounts a ConfigMap as a volume:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  -name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumeMounts:
    - name: foo
      mountPath: "/etc/foo"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    configMap:
      name: myconfigmap
```

If there are multiple containers in a Pod, each container needs its own `volumeMounts` block, but you only need to set one `spec.volumes` block per ConfigMap.

!!! note

    When a ConfigMap is used as a data volume mounted on a container, the ConfigMap can only be read as a read-only file.
