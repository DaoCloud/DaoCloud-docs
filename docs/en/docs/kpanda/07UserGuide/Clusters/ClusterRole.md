# cluster roles

DaoCloud Enterprise 5.0 classifies the roles of clusters based on their different functional orientations to help users better manage IT infrastructure.

## Global service cluster

This cluster is used to run DCE 5.0 components such as container management, global management, observability, registry, etc.
Generally, no business load is carried.
