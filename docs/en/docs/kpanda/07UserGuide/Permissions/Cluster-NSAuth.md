# Cluster and Namespace Authorization

Container management implements authorization based on global authority management and global user/user group management. If you need to grant users the highest authority for container management (you can create, manage, and delete all clusters), please refer to [What are users and access control](.. /../../ghippo/04UserGuide/01UserandAccess/iam.md).

## Prerequisites

Before authorizing users/user groups, complete the following preparations:

- The user/user group to be authorized has been created in the global management, please refer to [User](../../../ghippo/04UserGuide/01UserandAccess/User.md).

- Only [`Kpanda Owner`](../../../ghippo/04UserGuide/01UserandAccess/global.md) and [`Cluster Admin`](PermissionBrief.md#cluster-admin) of the current cluster have cluster authorization ability. For details, please refer to [Permission Description](PermissionBrief.md).

- Only [`Kpanda Owner`](../../../ghippo/04UserGuide/01UserandAccess/global.md), [`Cluster Admin`](PermissionBrief.md#cluster-admin) for the current cluster, currently named The [`NS Admin`](PermissionBrief.md#ns-admin) of the space has the namespace authorization capability.
