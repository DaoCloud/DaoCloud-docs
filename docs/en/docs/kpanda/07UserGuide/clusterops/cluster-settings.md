# cluster settings

Cluster settings are used to customize advanced feature settings for your cluster, including whether to enable GPU, Helm warehouse refresh cycle, Helm operation record retention, etc.

- Enable GPU: GPU cards and corresponding driver plug-ins need to be installed on the cluster in advance.

    Click the name of the target cluster, and click `Recent Operations`->`Cluster Settings`->`Addon Plugins` in the left navigation bar.
