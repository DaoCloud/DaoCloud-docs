# Cluster node shrinkage

When the peak business period is over, in order to save resource costs, you can reduce the size of the cluster and unload redundant nodes, that is, node scaling. After a node is uninstalled, applications cannot continue to run on the node.

## Prerequisites

- The current operating user has the [`Cluster Admin`](../Permissions/PermissionBrief.md) role authorization.
- Node expansion and contraction are only supported through the container management platform [Created Cluster](../Clusters/CreateCluster.md), and externally accessed clusters do not support this operation.
- Before uninstalling a node, you need to [pause scheduling the node](schedule.md), and expel the applications on the node to other nodes.
- Eviction method: log in to the controller node, and use the kubectl drain command to evict all Pods on the node. The safe eviction method allows the containers in the container group to terminate gracefully.

## Precautions

1. When cluster nodes shrink, they can only be uninstalled one by one, not in batches.

2. If you need to uninstall cluster controller nodes, you need to ensure that the final number of controller nodes is an **odd number**.

3. The **first controller** node cannot be offline when the cluster node shrinks. If it is necessary to perform this operation, please contact the after-sales engineer.

## Steps

1. On the `Cluster List` page, click the name of the target cluster.

    If the `Cluster Role` has the tag `Access Cluster`, it means that the cluster does not support node expansion and contraction.

2. Click `Node Management` on the left navigation bar, find the node to be uninstalled, click `âµ—` and select `Remove Node`.

3. Enter the node name, and click `Delete` to confirm.
