# Manage Helm applications

The container management module supports interface-based management of Helm, including creating Helm instances using Helm templates, customizing Helm instance parameters, and managing the full lifecycle of Helm instances.

This section will take [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) as an example to introduce how to create and manage Helm applications through the container management interface.

## Prerequisites

- The container management platform [has joined the Kubernetes cluster](../Clusters/JoinACluster.md) or [has created the Kubernetes cluster](../Clusters/CreateCluster.md), and can access the UI interface of the cluster.

- Completed a [Namespace Creation](../Namespaces/createtens.md), [User Creation](../../../ghippo/04UserGuide/01UserandAccess/User.md), and created a Grant [`NS Admin`](../Permissions/PermissionBrief.md#ns-admin) or higher permissions, please refer to [Namespace Authorization](../Permissions/Cluster-NSAuth.md) for details.

## Install the Helm application

Follow the steps below to install the Helm application.

1. Click on a cluster name to enter `Cluster Details`.

2. In the left navigation bar, click `Helm Application` -> `Helm Template` to enter the Helm template page.

    On the Helm template page, select the [Helm repository](helm-repo.md) named `addon`, and all the Helm chart templates under the `addon` repository will be displayed on the interface.
    Click on the Chart named `cert-manager`.

3. On the installation page, you can see the relevant detailed information of the Chart, select the version to be installed in the upper right corner of the interface, and click the `Install` button. Here select v1.9.1 version for installation.

4. Configure `Name`, `Namespace` and `Version Information`. You can also customize parameters by modifying YAML in the **Parameter Configuration** area below. Click `OK`.

5. The system will automatically return to the list of Helm applications, and the status of the newly created Helm application is `Installing`, and the status will change to `Running` after a period of time.

## Update the Helm application

After we have completed the installation of a Helm application through the interface, we can perform an update operation on the Helm application. Note: Update operations using the UI are only supported for Helm apps installed via the UI.

Follow the steps below to update the Helm application.

1. Click on a cluster name to enter `Cluster Details`.

    ![helm](../../images/crd01.png)

2. On the left navigation bar, click `Helm Application` to enter the Helm application list page.

    On the Helm application list page, select the Helm application that needs to be updated, click the `...` operation button on the right side of the list, and select the `Update` operation in the drop-down selection.

3. After clicking the `Update` button, the system will jump to the update interface, where you can update the Helm application as needed. Here we take updating the http port of the `dao-2048` application as an example.

4. After modifying the corresponding parameters. You can click the `Change` button under the parameter configuration to compare the files before and after the modification. After confirming that there is no error, click the `OK` button at the bottom to complete the update of the Helm application.

5. The system will automatically return to the Helm application list, and a pop-up window in the upper right corner will prompt `update successful`.

## View Helm operation records

Every installation, update, and deletion of Helm applications has detailed operation records and logs for viewing.

1. In the left navigation bar, click `Cluster Operations` -> `Recent Operations`, and then select the `Helm Operations` tab at the top of the page. Each record corresponds to an install/update/delete operation.

Follow the steps below to delete the Helm application.

1. Find the cluster where the Helm application to be deleted resides, click the cluster name, and enter `Cluster Details`.

    ![helm](../../images/crd01.png)

2. In the left navigation bar, click `Helm Application` to enter the Helm application list page.

    On the Helm application list page, select the Helm application you want to delete, click the `...` operation button on the right side of the list, and select `Delete` from the drop-down selection.
