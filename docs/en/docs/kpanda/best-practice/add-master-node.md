# Scaling Controller Nodes in a Worker Cluster

This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to manually scale the control nodes in a worker cluster to achieve high availability for self-built clusters.

!!! note

    It is recommended to enable high availability mode when creating the worker cluster in the interface. Manually scaling the control nodes of the worker cluster involves certain operational risks, so please proceed with caution.

## Prerequisites

- A worker cluster has been created using the DCE 5.0 platform. You can refer to the documentation on [Creating a Worker Cluster](../user-guide/clusters/create-cluster.md).
- The managed cluster associated with the worker cluster exists in the current platform and is running normally.

!!! note

    Managed cluster refers to the cluster specified during the creation of the worker cluster, which provides capabilities such as Kubernetes version upgrades, node scaling, uninstallation, and operation records for the current cluster.

## Modify the Host manifest

1. Log in to the container management platform and go to the overview page of the cluster where you want to scale the control nodes. In the __Basic Information__ section, locate the **Managed Cluster** of the current cluster and click its name to enter the overview page.


2. In the overview page of the managed cluster, click **Console** to open the cloud terminal console. Run the following command to find the host manifest of the worker cluster that needs to be scaled.

    ```bash
    kubectl get cm -n kubean-system ${ClusterName}-hosts-conf -oyaml
    ```

    `${ClusterName}` is the name of the worker cluster to be scaled.

3. Modify the host manifest file based on the example below and add information for the controller nodes.

## Add Expansion Task "scale-master-node-ops.yaml" using the ClusterOperation.yml Template

Use the following `ClusterOperation.yml` template to add a cluster control node expansion task called "scale-master-node-ops.yaml". 

```yaml title="ClusterOperation.yml"
apiVersion: kubean.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterOperation
metadata:
  name: cluster1-online-install-ops
spec:
  cluster: ${cluster-name} # Specify cluster name
  image: ghcr.m.daocloud.io/kubean-io/spray-job:v0.18.0 # Specify the image for the kubean job
  actionType: playbook
  action: cluster.yml
  extraArgs: --limit=etcd,kube_control_plane -e ignore_assert_errors=yes
  preHook:
    - actionType: playbook
      action: ping.yml
    - actionType: playbook
      action: disable-firewalld.yml
    - actionType: playbook
      action: enable-repo.yml  # In an offline environment, you need to add this yaml and
      # set the correct repo-list (for installing operating system packages).
      # The following parameter values are for reference only.
      extraArgs: |
        -e "{repo_list: ['http://172.30.41.0:9000/kubean/centos/\$releasever/os/\$basearch','http://172.30.41.0:9000/kubean/centos-iso/\$releasever/os/\$basearch']}"
  postHook:
    - actionType: playbook
      action: upgrade-cluster.yml
      extraArgs: --limit=etcd,kube_control_plane -e ignore_assert_errors=yes
    - actionType: playbook
      action: kubeconfig.yml
    - actionType: playbook
      action: cluster-info.yml
```

!!! note

    - spec.image: The image address should be consistent with the image within the job that was previously deployed
    - spec.action: set to cluster.yml, if adding Master (etcd) nodes exceeds (including) three
      at once, additional parameter `-e etcd_retries=10` should be added to cluster.yaml to
      increase etcd node join retry times
    - spec.extraArgs: set to `--limit=etcd,kube_control_plane -e ignore_assert_errors=yes`
    - If it is an offline environment, spec.preHook needs to add enable-repo.yml, and the
      extraArgs parameter should fill in the correct repo_list for the relevant OS
    - spec.postHook.action: should include upgrade-cluster.yml, where extraArgs is set to
      `--limit=etcd,kube_control_plane -e ignore_assert_errors=yes`

Create and deploy scale-master-node-ops.yaml based on the above configuration.

```bash
# Copy the above manifest
vi scale-master-node-ops.yaml
kubectl apply -f scale-master-node-ops.yaml -n kubean-system
```

Perform the following command to verify it.

```bash
kubectl get node
```
