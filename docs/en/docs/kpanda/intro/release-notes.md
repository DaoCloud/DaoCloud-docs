#### Improvements

- **Improved** The cluster drop-down list supports the display of cluster status, and optimizes the
  user’s experience of selecting the managed cluster when creating a cluster, selecting the target cluster
  when creating a namespace, and selecting the target cluster when authorizing a cluster.
