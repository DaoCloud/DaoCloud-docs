# Enable/Disable collection of audit logs

- Kubernetes Audit Logs: Kubernetes itself generates audit logs. When this feature is enabled, audit log files for Kubernetes will be created in the specified directory.
- Collecting Kubernetes Audit Logs: The log files mentioned above are collected using the Insight Agent. The prerequisite for collecting Kubernetes audit logs is that the cluster has enabled Kubernetes audit logs.

## DCE 5.0 Installation Status

- For DCE Community installations, the Kubernetes audit log switch was not operated during the management cluster installation process.
- For DCE 5.0 Enterprise installations, the Kubernetes audit log switch is enabled by default.
    - To set it to default off, you can modify the installer's `clusterConfigt.yaml` file (set `logPath` to empty "").
- The collection of Kubernetes audit logs switch is disabled by default for the management cluster.
    - Default settings do not support configuration.

## Management Cluster Collection of Kubernetes Audit Logs Switch

### DCE 5.0 Enterprise Installation Environment

#### Confirm Enabling Kubernetes Audit Logs

Run the following command to check if audit logs are generated under the `/var/log/kubernetes/audit` directory. If they exist, it means that Kubernetes audit logs are successfully enabled.

```shell
ls /var/log/kubernetes/audit
```

If they are not enabled, please refer to the [documentation on enabling/disabling Kubernetes audit logs](open-k8s-audit.md).

#### Enable Collection of Kubernetes Audit Logs Process

1. Add ChartMuseum to the helm repo.

    ```shell
    helm repo add chartmuseum http://10.5.14.30:8081
    ```

    Modify the IP address in this command to the IP address of the Spark node.

    !!! note

        If using a self-built Harbor repository, please modify the chart repo URL in the first step to the insight-agent chart URL of the self-built repository.

2. Save the current Insight Agent helm values.

    ```shell
    helm get values insight-agent -n insight-system -o yaml > insight-agent-values-bak.yaml
    ```

3. Get the current version number ${insight_version_code}.

    ```shell
    insight_version_code=`helm list -n insight-system |grep insight-agent | awk {'print $10'}`
    ```

4. Update the helm value configuration.

    ```shell
    helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --version ${insight_version_code} --cleanup-on-fail insight-agent chartmuseum/insight-agent -n insight-system -f insight-agent-values-bak.yaml --set global.exporters.auditLog.kubeAudit.enabled=true
    ```

5. Restart all fluentBit pods under the insight-system namespace.

    ```shell
    fluent_pod=`kubectl get pod -n insight-system | grep insight-agent-fluent-bit | awk {'print $1'} | xargs`
    kubectl delete pod ${fluent_pod} -n insight-system
    ```

#### Disable Collection of Kubernetes Audit Logs

The remaining steps are the same as enabling the collection of Kubernetes audit logs, with only a modification in the previous section's step 4: updating the helm value configuration.

```shell
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --version ${insight_version_code} --cleanup-on-fail insight-agent chartmuseum/insight-agent -n insight-system -f insight-agent-values-bak.yaml --set global.exporters.auditLog.kubeAudit.enabled=false
```

### DCE Community Online Installation Environment

!!! note

   If installing DCE Community in a Kind cluster, perform the following steps inside the Kind container.

#### Confirm Enabling Kubernetes Audit Logs

Run the following command to check if audit logs are generated under the `/var/log/kubernetes/audit` directory. If they exist, it means that Kubernetes audit logs are successfully enabled.

```shell
ls /var/log/kubernetes/audit
```

If they are not enabled, please refer to the [documentation on enabling/disabling Kubernetes audit logs](open-k8s-audit.md).

#### Enable Collection of Kubernetes Audit Logs Process

1. Save the current values.

    ```shell
    helm get values insight-agent -n insight-system -o yaml > insight-agent-values-bak.yaml
    ```

2. Get the current version number ${insight_version_code} and update the configuration.

    ```shell
    insight_version_code=`helm list -n insight-system |grep insight-agent | awk {'print $10'}`
    ```

3. Update the helm value configuration.

    ```shell
    helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --version ${insight_version_code} --cleanup-on-fail insight-agent insight-release/insight-agent -n insight-system -f insight-agent-values-bak.yaml --set global.exporters.auditLog.kubeAudit.enabled=true
    ```

    If the upgrade fails due to an unsupported version, check if the helm repo used in the command has that version.
    If not, retry after you updated the helm repo.

    ```shell
    helm repo update insight-release
    ```

4. Restart all fluentBit pods under the insight-system namespace.

    ```shell
    fluent_pod=`kubectl get pod -n insight-system | grep insight-agent-fluent-bit | awk {'print $1'} | xargs`
    kubectl delete pod ${fluent_pod} -n insight-system
    ```

#### Disable Collection of Kubernetes Audit Logs

The remaining steps are the same as enabling the collection of Kubernetes audit logs, with only a modification in the previous section's step 3: updating the helm value configuration.

```shell
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --version ${insight_version_code} --cleanup-on-fail insight-agent insight-release/insight-agent -n insight-system -f insight-agent-values-bak.yaml --set global.exporters.auditLog.kubeAudit.enabled=false
```

## Work Cluster Switch

Each work cluster switch is independent and can be turned on as needed.

### Steps to Enable Audit Log Collection When Creating a Cluster

By default, the collection of K8s audit logs is turned off. If you need to enable it, you can follow these steps:

![Default Off](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/ghippo/images/worker01.png)

![Enable Audit Logs](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/ghippo/images/worker02.png)

Set the switch to the enabled state to enable the collection of K8s audit logs.

When creating a work cluster via DCE 5.0, ensure that the K8s audit log option for the cluster is set to 'true' so that the created work cluster will have audit logs enabled.

![Audit Logs Enabled](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/ghippo/images/worker03.png)

After the cluster creation is successful, the K8s audit logs for that work cluster will be collected.

### Steps to Enable/Disable After Accessing or Creating the Cluster

#### Confirm Enabling K8s Audit Logs

Run the following command to check if audit logs are generated under the `/var/log/kubernetes/audit` directory. If they exist, it means that K8s audit logs are successfully enabled.

```shell
ls /var/log/kubernetes/audit
```

If they are not enabled, please refer to the [documentation on enabling/disabling K8s audit logs](open-k8s-audit.md).

#### Enable Collection of K8s Audit Logs

The collection of K8s audit logs is disabled by default. To enable it, follow these steps:

1. Select the cluster that has been accessed and needs to enable the collection of K8s audit logs.

    ![Select Cluster](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/ghippo/images/worker04.png)

2. Go to the Helm application management page and update the insight-agent configuration (if insight-agent is not installed, you can [install it](../../../insight/quickstart/install/install-agent.md)).

    ![Go to Helm Applications](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/ghippo/images/worker05.png)

3. Enable/Disable the collection of K8s audit logs switch.

    ![Enable/Disable Switch](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/ghippo/images/worker06.png)

4. After enabling/disabling the switch, the fluent-bit pod needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

    ![Restart Pods](https://docs.daocloud.io/daocloud-docs-images/docs/ghippo/images/worker07.png)
