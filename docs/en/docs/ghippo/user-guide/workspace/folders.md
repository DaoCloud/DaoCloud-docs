Folders have the capability to map permissions, allowing users/user groups to have their permissions in the folder mapped to its sub-folders, workspaces, and resources.

Follow the steps below to create a folder:

1. Log in to DCE 5.0 with a user account having the admin/folder admin role.
   Click __Global Management__ -> __Workspace and Folder__ at the bottom of the left navigation bar.
