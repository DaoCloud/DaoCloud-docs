# Reset Password

If you forget your password, you can reset it by following the instructions on this page.

## Steps to Reset Password

When an administrator initially creates a user, it sets a username and password for him.
After the user logs in, fill in the email address and change the password in __Personal Center__ .
If the user has not set an email address, he can only contact the administrator to reset the password.

1. If you forget your password, you can click __Forgot your password?__ on the login interface.

   or other devices. Set up a dynamic password to activate your account, and click __Submit__ .
