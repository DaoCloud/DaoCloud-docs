# Workspaces (tenants) bind namespaces across clusters

Namespaces from different clusters are bound under the workspace (tenant), which enables the workspace (tenant) to flexibly manage the Kubernetes Namespace under any cluster on the platform.
At the same time, the platform provides permission mapping capabilities, which can map the user's permissions in the workspace to the bound namespace.

When one or more cross-cluster namespaces are bound under the workspace (tenant), the administrator does not need to authorize the members in the workspace again.
The roles of members in the workspace will be automatically mapped according to the following mapping relationship to complete the authorization, avoiding repeated operations of multiple authorizations:

- Workspace Admin corresponds to Namespace Admin
- Workspace Editor corresponds to Namespace Editor
- Workspace Viewer corresponds to Namespace Viewer

Here is an example:

| User | Workspace | Role |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| User A | Workspace01 | Workspace Admin |

After binding a namespace to a workspace:

| User | Category | Role |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| User A | Workspace01 | Workspace Admin |
| | Namespace01 | Namespace Admin |

## Implementation plan

Bind different namespaces from different clusters to the same workspace (tenant), and use the process for members under the workspace (tenant) as shown in the figure.

!!! tip

    A namespace can only be bound by one workspace.

## Prepare workspace

In order to meet the multi-tenant usage scenarios, the workspace forms an isolated resource environment based on multiple resources such as clusters, cluster namespaces, meshs, mesh namespaces, multicloud, and multicloud namespaces.
Workspaces can be mapped to various concepts such as projects, tenants, enterprises, and suppliers.

1. Log in to the web console as a user with the admin/folder admin role, and click `Global Management` at the bottom of the left navigation bar.

    ![Global Management](../../images/ws01.png)

1. Click `Workspace and Hierarchy` in the left navigation bar, and click the `Create Workspace` button in the upper right corner.

    ![Create workspace](../../images/ws02.png)

1. After filling in the workspace name, folder and other information, click `OK` to complete the creation of the workspace.

    ![OK](../../images/ws03.png)

Tip: If the created namespace already exists in the platform, click on a workspace, and under the `Resource Group` tab, click `Bind Resource` to directly bind the namespace.

## Prepare the namespace

A namespace is a smaller unit of resource isolation that can be managed and used by members of a workspace after it is bound to a workspace.

Follow the steps below to prepare a namespace that is not yet bound to any workspace.

1. Click `Container Management` at the bottom of the left navigation bar.

    ![Container Management](../../images/crd00.png)

1. Click the name of the target cluster to enter `Cluster Details`.

    ![Cluster Details](../../../kpanda/images/crd01.png)

1. Click `Namespace` on the left navigation bar to enter the namespace management page, and click the `Create` button on the right side of the page.

    ![create namespace](../../../kpanda/images/ns01.png)

1. Fill in the name of the namespace, configure the workspace and tags (optional settings), and click `OK`.

    !!! info

        Workspaces are primarily used to divide groups of resources and grant users (groups of users) different access rights to that resource. For a detailed description of the workspace, please refer to [Workspace and Hierarchy](../../../ghippo/04UserGuide/02Workspace/Workspaces.md).

    ![Fill](../../../kpanda/images/ns02.png)

1. Click `OK` to complete the creation of the namespace. On the right side of the namespace list, click `â‹®`, and you can select `Bind Workspace` from the pop-up menu.

    ![OK and bind](../../../kpanda/images/ns03.png)

## Bind the namespace to the workspace

In addition to binding in the namespace list, you can also return to `global management`, follow the steps below to bind the workspace.

1. Click `Global Management` -> `Workspace and Hierarchy` -> `Resource Group`, click a workspace name, and click the `Bind Resource` button.

    ![Bind resource](../../images/bind01.png)

1. Select the workspace to be bound (multiple choices are allowed), and click `OK` to complete the binding.

    ![OK](../../images/bind02.png)

## Add members to the workspace and authorize

1. In `Workspace and Hierarchy` -> `Authorization`, click the name of a workspace, and click the `Add Authorization` button.

    ![Add Authorization](../../images/wsauth01.png)

1. After selecting the `User/User Group` and `Role` to be authorized, click `OK` to complete the authorization.
