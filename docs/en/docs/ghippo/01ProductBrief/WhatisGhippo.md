# What is Global Management (Ghippo)？

Global Management (Ghippo) is a comprehensive user-centered service, including user and access control, enterprise space, audit log, platform configuration and other basic modules.

- [User and access control](../04UserGuide/01UserandAccess/global.md)：Help users manage access to resources. Users are allowed to create, manage, and delete users/user groups, and flexibly configure user/user group permissions to divide users' functional rights.

- [Enterprise space](../04UserGuide/02Workspace/ws-folder.md)：A resource isolation unit with hierarchical structure and capability of access control. Users are allowed to set hierarchical structure depending on the enterprise development environment, department structure, etc., and control who has access to which resources.

- [Audit log](../04UserGuide/03AuditLog.md)：Provide operation logs of resources, which allows security analysis, resource changes, problem location, etc.

- [Platform configuration](../04UserGuide/04PlatformSetting/MailServer.md)：Through platform security policy, mail server, appearance customization, etc., you can ensure secure user information and a personalized platform.

## Advantages

    The basic service modules of the platform are brought together to reduce the troubles caused by menu switching and function scattering. Platform administrators can complete basic settings and user management under one menu.

- Combination of users and tenants

    Flat management of users and user groups as well as hierarchical tenant (workspace) collaboration enable multi-dimensional and multi-scenario access control based on the platform and resource-based function division.

- Personalization

    Support personalized platform appearance, including custom login page and top navigation bar. Easily configure a unique platform through visual pages.
