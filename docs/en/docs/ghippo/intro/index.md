# What is Global Management (Ghippo)?

Global Management is a comprehensive, user-centred service that includes access control,
workspaces and folders, audit logs, platform settings, and other fundamental modules.

- [Access Control](../user-guide/access-control/global.md): Enables users to manage resource access by creating, managing, deleting users/groups and configuring their permissions.

- [Workspaces and Folders](../user-guide/workspace/ws-folder.md): provides a hierarchical structure for resource isolation and control over resource access. Users can set up a hierarchical structure depending on the development environment, and department structure, and control who has access to which resources.

- [Audit Logs](../user-guide/audit/audit-log.md): offer detailed operation records for security analysis and tracking resource changes.

- [Platform Settings](../user-guide/platform-setting/mail-server.md): Comprises security policies, mail server configuration, appearance customization, and more, ensuring secure user information and a personalized experience.

Global Management puts the basic service modules of the platform together to reduce the troubles
caused by menu switching and feature scattering. Platform administrators can complete basic settings
and user management under one menu. Flat management of users and groups as well as hierarchical tenant
(workspace) collaboration enable multi-dimensional and multi-scenario access control based on the
platform and resource-based feature division. Personalization options are available, allowing users
to customize the platform's appearance to their preferences. Global Management is designed to be
user-friendly, with most configurations pre-set for users, including password rules, session timeout
policies, and other settings that simplify user operations and ensure a smooth experience for beginners.
