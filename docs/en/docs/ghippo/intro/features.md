# Features

This page describes the features of Global Management.

1. Users

    Having a user account is a prerequisite for users to access the DCE platform.
    [User](../user-guide/access-control/user.md) is created by Admin or IAM Owner in __Global Management__ -> __Access Control__ -> __Users__ page, or connected via LDAP.
    Each user has an independent username and password. By granting different permissions to a single or a group of users, users have access to different resources.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR

        admin([Admin or<br>user and access administrator]) --> |create and manage users|user[User]
        user --> user1[User A]
        user --> user2[User B]
        user --> user3[User C]
        
    click user "https://docs.daocloud.io/en/ghippo/user-guide/access-control/user/"

    classDef plain fill:#ddd,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px,color:#000;
    classDef k8s fill:#326ce5,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px,color:#fff;
    classDef cluster fill:#fff,stroke:#bbb,stroke-width:2px,color:#326ce5;

    class admin plain;
    class user cluster
    ```

2. Groups

    [group](../user-guide/access-control/group.md) is a collection of multiple users.
    Users can inherit the role permissions of the group by joining the group. Authorize users in batches through groups to better manage users and their permissions.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR

        admin([Admin or<br>User and Access Administrator])
        admin --> user[Create user]
        admin --> group[Create group]
        admin --> add[Add user to group]
        
    click user "https://docs.daocloud.io/en/ghippo/user-guide/access-control/user/"
    click group "https://docs.daocloud.io/en/ghippo/user-guide/access-control/group/"
    click add "https://docs.daocloud.io/en/ghippo/user-guide/access-control/group/#add-users-to-a-group"

    classDef plain fill:#ddd,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px,color:#000;
    classDef k8s fill:#326ce5,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px,color:#fff;
    classDef cluster fill:#fff,stroke:#bbb,stroke-width:2px,color:#326ce5;

    class admin plain;
    class user,group,add cluster
    ```

3. Roles

    A [role](../user-guide/access-control/role.md) corresponds to a set of permissions.
    Permissions determine the actions that can be performed on a resource. Granting a role to a user grants all the permissions included in that role.
    You can divide the management rights of different modules to different users,
    For example, user A manages the container management module, user B manages Workbench module, and jointly manages the observability module.

4. Workspaces

    [Workspaces](../user-guide/workspace/workspace.md) are used to manage resources and consist of two parts: folders and workspaces.

    Levels represent nodes in the resource hierarchy, and each level can contain workspaces, other levels, or both. The hierarchy can be understood as a variety of concepts, such as hierarchical departments, environments, or suppliers.

    Workspaces can be thought of as projects under their respective department, and administrators can map the hierarchical relationship within the enterprise using the hierarchy and workspaces.

    Although a hierarchy may contain multiple hierarchies or workspaces, a given hierarchy or workspace can only have one parent.

5. Audit Logs

    [Audit Logs](../user-guide/audit/audit-log.md) completely records users' various operations, including operations initiated by users through pages or API interfaces and self-triggered operations within each service. It enables combined queries through multiple dimensions, such as event source, resource type, and operation status, and supports audit log export.

6. Platform Settings

    [Platform Settings](../user-guide/platform-setting/about.md) include account security settings, appearance customization, and mail server settings. When it is necessary to manage platform-level settings, such as account security information, platform logos, license authorization, and mail server, Admins can operate through __Settings__ . Admins have exclusive management rights for platform settings.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR

        admin([Admin]) --> |management|about[Platform settings]
        about --> password[User password and other security policies]
        about --> appear[Platform appearance customization]
        about --> mail[Mail server]
        about --> license[Genuine authorization]
