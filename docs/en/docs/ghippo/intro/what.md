# What is Global Management (Ghippo)？

Global Management (Ghippo) is a comprehensive user-centered service, including access control, enterprise space, audit log, platform configuration and other basic modules.

- [Access control](../04UserGuide/01UserandAccess/global.md)：Help users manage access to resources. Users are allowed to create, manage, and delete users/groups, and flexibly configure user/group permissions to divide users' functional rights.

- [Enterprise space](../04UserGuide/02Workspace/ws-folder.md)：A resource isolation unit with hierarchical structure and capability of access control. Users are allowed to set hierarchical structure depending on the enterprise development environment, department structure, etc., and control who has access to which resources.

- [Audit log](../04UserGuide/03AuditLog.md)：Provide operation logs of resources, which allows security analysis, resource changes, problem location, etc.

- [Platform configuration](../04UserGuide/04PlatformSetting/MailServer.md)：Through platform security policy, mail server, appearance customization, etc., you can ensure secure user information and a personalized platform.
