# DaoCloud Style Guide of Writing

This style guide is applicable to DaoCloud documentation.

## Images

It is always welcome if you can output some diagrams about architecture, modules, principle, features desc etc.

**A useful picture is worth of a thousand words.**

All images in a book or on a website shall have a consistent style and:

- Show all text cleary
- Fill in with all parameters rather than keep those fields blank
- Do not give a big blank space on your screenshot
- A mermaid image is prefered, which can provide much convenience for translation and localization

### Example

Bad:

![screenshots](./docs/zh/docs/blogs/images/style02.png)

This screenshot is clear but has much blank. In this case, you can drag your browser border to a suitable size before making the screenshot.

Good:

![screenshots](./docs/zh/docs/blogs/images/style03.png)

## Code and command

For a user guide about software products, it is very popular to show your code and its output to reproduce an actual environment.

**Talk is cheap, show me the code.**

For a code snippet, remember the followings to provide your readers:

- Show clearly
- Easy to read
- Easy to copy/paste
- Give some comments if possible
- Highlights with the code mark of c, c++, yaml, java, shell, bash, or go if you know.

### Bad

However, some images are not suggested, or even to avoid. For example, in a long article,
when you run a simple command and the system outputs something on your screen. In this
case, it's better to directly copy/paste your on-screen text rather than a screenshot as below.

![screenshots](./docs/zh/docs/blogs/images/style01.png)

As shown above, it's difficult to control the resolution and pixels of an image to adapt
to different device and cloud environment, and not easy to reproduce your dev, test, and
use environment. Few people may follow your screenshot to type the command letter by
letter again because the reader cannot view it clearly!

### Good example 1

Run the following command to check current pods:

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

The output is similar to:

```none
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
piraeus-cs-controller-6d7c6c9d75-5k2tw    1/1     Running   2 (16d ago)   20d
piraeus-csi-controller-65fbdb58dd-q2fp5   6/6     Running   4 (16d ago)   20d
piraeus-csi-node-6s5tx                    3/3     Running   3 (14d ago)   20d
piraeus-csi-node-7rwcf                    3/3     Running   3 (14d ago)   20d
piraeus-csi-node-q6nn7                    3/3     Running   1 (17d ago)   20d
```

### Good example 2

For some YAML files, you need to ensure all intendations are correct and provide a code symbol at the start.
Refer to [yaml.org](https://yaml.org/).

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  template:
    # This is the pod template
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: hello
          image: busybox:1.28
          command: ["sh", "-c", 'echo "Hello, Kubernetes!" && sleep 3600']
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
    # The pod template ends here
```

## List

DCE 5.0 website is compiled and built with Mkdocs, which requires 4 spaces for a list.

Here are some tips for your list writing:

- Do not use orphan item in a list. A list contains at least two items.
- Use an ordered list for a procedure with sequence.
- Use an unordered list for features, benefits, and more without sequence.

```none
1. A first item in an ordered list

    - unordered list one
        - unordered list one
        - unordered list two
    - unordered list two

1. A second item with an ordered list

    1. Embedded list one
        1. Embedded list one
        1. Embedded list two
    1. Embedded list two

1. A third item in an ordered list
```

The output is:

1. A first item in an ordered list

    - unordered list one
        - unordered list one
        - unordered list two
    - unordered list two

1. A second item with an ordered list

    1. Embedded list one
        1. Embedded list one
        1. Embedded list two
    1. Embedded list two

1. A third item in an ordered list

Refer to [MkDocs list](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/lists/#using-unordered-lists).

## Table

The semantic purpose of a data table is to present tabular data.

DCE docs is written with markdown. The table is not recommended but sometimes hard to avoid.
In this case, a table cannot be indented, otherwise the table style will be lost.
One suggestion is to put all parameter tables in a page.

Alternatively, a table can easily show comparison, for example:

```none
| Do                          | Don't                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| To create a ReplicaSet,     | In order to create a ReplicaSet,             |
| See the configuration file. | Please see the configuration file.           |
| View the pods.              | With this next command, we'll view the pods. |
```

The output is:

| Do                          | Don't                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| To create a ReplicaSet,     | In order to create a ReplicaSet,             |
| See the configuration file. | Please see the configuration file.           |
| View the pods.              | With this next command, we'll view the pods. |

Refer to [MkDocs table](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/data-tables/).

## Text

A successful manual provides users with quick answers to the questions that they might have.

## Keep simple and consistent

Using overly technical jargon will only serve to confuse your readers and frustrate them when they are looking for a simple answer.
Use language that your customers will find easy to understand. If you must use a technical term, explain it or link to a glossary.

To keep your documentation consistent, the topic you write shall be clear and easy to follow, and include the vital components needed for each step.
Keep your content consistent including but not limited to:

- Steps
- Warnings and call-outs
- Font
- Size
- Color
- Glossary

### Example: You or We

User manuals should always focus on the reader.
When writing information that involves the reader, such as instructions, use **you** and the active voice.
Speaking directly to the reader will:

- Reinforce the message that the information is intended for the reader
- Pull readers into the document and make it relevant to them
- Help to avoid passive voice by focusing on the reader

A bad example due to lack of reader focus:

```none
There are three options for viewing content in the editor.
We have three options for viewing content in the editor.
```

A good example due to reader focus:

```none
You can choose one of three options for viewing content in the editor.
```

The sentence that uses “you” focuses on the reader and makes it clear that the reader is the person doing the action.
You should aim to use “you” in your writing to make the content more relevant to the reader.

## Tips about markdown

Before you push your changes to a markdown file, it is recommended to run the following command to make your markdown beautiful:

```
npx prettier --w filename
```

See [prettier documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) to install, it's very easy to use.

> Note: You shall manually check the format and layout again after you run the prettier command,
> which can automatically adjust your markdown to the standard format.
